        Platonic Pandemic: Part1. Feelings
Prologue 
Broken Bridge
In the beginning it was just a vague but tough feeling. That empty, harsh and desperate feeling that used to overwhelm me. But, I had no way to know where it was coming from. People told me it is no surprise it is tough to earn money working in a competitive company. It is not just you but everybody else feel the same, so don’t be too sad. That’s the way it goes.  
Still, I couldn’t convince myself of the nasty recurrent feeling. There should be something more specific to it. It wasn’t easy to dig in what it was. Feelings were evanescent that easily gone and forgotten. I was also always chased by loads of daily client works to manage. 
Sigfried Giedion, an American historian, wrote about the significance of feelings and emotions in his renowned book, Space, Time and Architecture. Our lives are largely influenced by living at a common period, and it leaves a marked unity of feeling among many of us. Meaning a certain feeling of an individual could be a stamp of the period where he is located. He also mentions the role of bridge between feeling and thinking criticizing his era that art is failing to reveal the feeling of the age while science is dramatically evolving the way we think. That his age lost the unity because the bridge between feeling and thinking was broken. 
To explain my case borrowing his words, it was upside down. Feeling was flourishing, but thinking wasn’t following it. I wasn’t getting what my feeling was talking about. Rebuilding bridge between feeling and thinking was equally important in my case though. 
Rebuilding the bridge meant having a systematic understanding of the world where I was living. It took time to see what lies behind that nasty feeling. It took several years until I found right words for my feeling that reveal what its essence was. Two French intellectuals already had their words for the feeling similar to mine that I was suffering for years. Jean Baudrillard and Marcel Ayme. Violence of market economy. Sacrificing the (unmeasurable) value of time for monthly salary. Endless loop of consumption of time for consumption of money.
Baudrillard analyses consumer society in his book, the System of Objects. “The destiny of consumer society is the functionalization of the consumer himself, the psychological monopolization of all needs.” We must have been born with unique taste and needs. But, we all want more or less similar goods and similar life style. That was the essence of the work I spend majority of my time for, marketing. Marketer’s task is to make as many consumers as possible to long for a single target, a client’s brand. 
Marcel Aymé wrote a short piece, Tickets on Time. In the story, useless people - seniors, artists - are deprived of part of their time. People of full time job retain their 24 hours. The more practical and stable job you have, the more time you obtain. The richer, the more time you obtain. The poor even sell their time to make living or because their finance can’t manage to live full time. Part timers are forced to live a part time life. This is an interesting novel, but it is actually happening. Money take care of wasteful stuffs to earn you more time to do what you want. And I am selling my time to make living. 
I wasn’t sure if others were feeling the same feeling that I was feeling. I didn’t believe that market economy is a total evil because some part of market and marketing activities had good intention and was making this society better. The CEO of Patagonia, an American outdoor apparel, donated the entire property for the climate change. But as for me, the time was up. I thought I had to stop spending or selling my time supporting a metaphysical violence. My wish was to replace my service for “the obligation to buy” with service for “the obligation to difficult whole.” 

Sign of Diastrophism
I Just want to confess this. Those various storms to come never came in a shape of my prediction. All were as badly unique and genuine as to break myself into pieces. Nevertheless, I’d have to say the storm has already begun years ago in my mind. No, rather in my heart. 
We all live our own metaphorical life. Perhaps because we seek for a meaning. Meaning is the source of will to live. What’s the fun of pure objective life unless you are an AI? Even acute judgement of a lawyer, deep down below, stands upon his personal desire for money or better world. I like Kafka on the Shore by Haruki. A fifteen year old boy, Tamura Kafka, fall in love with a women in her 50s just like his father prophesied. The woman, Saeki, open her mind to this seemingly ridiculous lover but taking him as her ex boyfriend who passed away decades ago. And Kafka willingly accepts his metaphorically becoming her ex boyfriend in order to take back the lost motherhood. In that way, both of them find meaning from each other. 

It’s not that I’ll tell a love story that was so dramatical that seemed to be a destiny. It’s not exactly about love. It is just a powerful crack or invisible diastrophism within my heart. I met her for a blind date on Saturday. She visited a wedding ceremony of her friend’s before meeting me. A black container of DSLR camera was in her hands, not exactly perfect fit to her very formal outfit. 
 
She said she had to return the camera before nine pm which she borrowed at downtown. She couldn’t though because time just sneaked away once we began to walk and talk together. It was the end of autumn and winter was just beginning. 
I tried to explain what was happening when I began to meet her, and crustal movement was the metaphor of my choice. Something unprecedented was happening. The geography of the whole inner world was getting through a whole reorganization. Although deeply personal, it was a very concrete phenomena in my mental landscape. It was as concrete as climate change or earthquake. 
So, my take is perhaps the crustal movement forecasted all the following diastrophism to come. I just never knew it did at the moment. All I knew was I lost control by an ever-powerful emotion. There was nothing I could do but just sit and wait for the storm to cease. 
When the storm ceased by the time cherry blossom was in its climax, I found myself like in a post World War ll Tokyo, or Seoul after the Korean War. Just like the old monochromatic pictures in the textbooks. Or like Leonardo Dicaprio in his Oscar winning film, ——, attacked by a huge bear to near death. It was a complete mess, a total chaos, with all collapsed and nothing left. I think I deserved it. At least it happened, and I can’t change the fact anymore. The entirety of myself fell down. 
From then on I rebuilt myself slowly. That was it. 
Perhaps, metaphorically speaking, all these visible storms lately are tests to see if my construction was solid and thorough enough. They are all alike. I don’t know if I deserve them again, but they are happening in more realistic and worldwide scale. Physical representations of those emotional storms. I can’t change the fact. I’ve been just trying to move forward this time, step by step, instead of being idle and waiting for it to cease. In the middle of the way I feel like I am shipwrecked in LA.

[Re Order] Influenza on a Christmas Eve
One day, I went to a hospital during work hours. The symptom was hard to endure, both physically and mentally. So, I submitted one day sick-leave at the office and left to a nearby hospital. I had in mind that I’ll just skip the hospital visit and go home to take a break alone. But, a humble and age-old sign just caught my eyes before walking down into the metro station. It was a small hospital with a lobby having no more than 5 seats. 
The doctor looked into my mouth and told me to wait at the sofa giving me a tester for influenza. I’ve never been infected by influenza as far as I remember. Anyways, I just did as told to do though. The tester turned out positive. I was given a medical mask by a nurse at the reception desk. It was highly contagious they had said. The diagnosis was quite surprising and unexpected. At the same time, I saw a dim light coming through from beyond the darkness. Yes, it was an opportunity. Influenza is contagious and I was advised not to go to work before I recover. What else could make myself happier? 
There was a story behind my delight. I was preparing for an application for a graduate school. I need to make a portfolio which I hand’t even started pagination. I didn’t even know if I was running out of time or how much time I would need to complete it. It was due 2nd January. Less than 10 days to go. The diagnosis gave me a solid and truthful reason to extend my sick leave to a week long. 
Sweating by fever, I managed to arrange it all on my way home with my cell phone. Talked with my supervisor, colleagues and submitted five days of sick leave on the corporate intranet system. Upon getting home, I directly headed to a supermarket and bought a big box of mandarine orange, sweets, and other good-for-your health food. I had to recover as quickly as possible to earn as much time to invest in my portfolio as I could.  
I made a grande size of hot honey tea and laid on the bed with a thick warm blanket up to my chin. It was afternoon, still bright outside. Tomorrow was Christmas Eve. I would just do sleep, drink hot tea, have enough food, take medicine, and lots of mandarine orange. Fever was for sure harsh at night but gone by the next day. My body felt a bit heavy and numb but I was pretty well just like that. 
I visited an art and craft shop twice. Bought potential materials for making models. Huge amount and diverse kinds so I am still using some of remaining things. I cut, sawed, grinded, and assembled materials. I stayed up three consecutive nights. That gave me a new sensation in my head. It felt like a belt was binding the perimeter of my brain tightly ever. As tightly as the due date was pressing my schedule. 
I still needed more time. But I knew I would never have enough time in any ways this time. My portfolio was crude, and essays were not clear what I want to say. One thing clear was that I felt a fever. It was not clear whether it was the leftover of symptom of influenza or a new delight of creating my design work. Anyways, the fever kept me awake at nights at the end of year 2018. At the end of the sick leave, it turned to a new year. Then it was clear to me that the fever in my mind was totally different from the fever of influenza. Probably it just transformed throughout the long days and nights, through the X-mas, my birthday, and New Year’s eve. 
After new year’s holiday, there was something a little different in the air than the last year. Nobody knew what really happened even not me. 

Diastrophism in Tokyo
I was having an Acai Bowl at a cafe in Harajuku, Tokyo. I was on my business trip. 
Usually having brunch at that cafe, I would thought about earthquake watching down the long harajuku street on the left. A couple of years ago, a serious earthquake had occurred in Pohang, my hometown in Korea. Tokyo was notorious for an earthquake too. If I quit my job, then it should be something like an earthquake. It was scary, but I was longing for it with all my heart. I tried to convince myself it should be a scary disaster because my pure longing for resign seemed just too naive. But it was not that I tried to reject my will to quit someday. I wanted to be as unbiased and reasonable on this issue. I just wanted to be practically ready also. 
Many people around me left their job to study abroad I heard. Also I heard a year or two later they came back to work just like a couple years ago. It was a kind of long term holiday, which should be not bad. However, that was not what I was aiming at. It seemed like a VR experience for a past time. To say, a fake experience. I might be too pessimistic. VR experience ends as if nothing happened once you take off the VR glass, which is true. I wanted a real experience, that would not be able to set back to the status before. Just like a diastrophism. Like a crustal movement that changes a whole landscape from the beginning. 
That was why it was scary as well as attractive. With an Acai Bowl on the table, I opened an email notice of the result of my application. I believed in the possibility of acceptance. The possibility of irrevocable diastrophism. But it didn’t happen that day. I fell in despair, and at the same time I was relieved. OK, not this time. Another year to prepare for this earthquake. Another year to endure tedious, reluctant and meaningless job. Selling my time for money. 
Fever was not enough to bring about a change. 

A Midsummer Day’s Highline
I was working day and night. It was a huge project for a product launching in New York. Working so hard that totally forgot the winter fever or resolution with Açai Bowl. That eager enthusiasm completely gone for several months! That was the reason why I felt I was not doing well upon arrival at the hotel in New York early August. There was something wrong. 
It wasn’t that the plan was gone like wind. I even made an GRE test appointment right after the business schedule. But, the thing was I prepared nothing for the exam. I had been a pure dedicative workaholic for 2-3 months. Providing full service to my clients for their brand to dominate the market. 
I couldn’t even finish the exam. I didn’t have enough concentration to keep up with a series of questions. During almost half of given time, I was just holding my pencil above the paper. I just tasted bitter, pure bitter emptiness. There was something wrong. 
I stayed in a different hotel that had partial ocean view. I walked around the city. I couldn’t stand the sun that I bought sunglasses at a shop near Whitney Museum of Art. There began the Highline. 
It was an awesome walk. Relieving, refreshing, energizing, and more importantly inspiring. There was a big clock, a monumental statue, on the right. And that struck me hard. Its face was no more than a traditional clock with hands and numbers. But, it also had some messages. — Time to organize. Organize right, organize now. 
I didn’t know it was an artwork by Ruth Ewan, titled ‘Silent Agitator.’ The official website writes that The clock is based on an illustration originally produced for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) labor union by the North American writer and labor activist Ralph Chaplin that reads “What time is it? Time to organize!”  So, it was a strong call to action for industrial workers. 
Maybe I was one of them. I felt almost shot by the phrases. It was time to decide and act. No more hesitation. Time to choose what I really want and give up what’s not essential. I had been mechanically purchasing monthly salary for my life time. And that purchase of money was going nowhere but to purchase of time, and then to purchase of money, and to purchase of time. An endless loop, empty as hell. It was time to cut off the loop. 
I began to wake up at 4 am to study. Upon waking up did I go outside still in dark because I was not able to bare sleep inside. I used to put my Helinox camping chair beside outdoor bench in Contemporary Museum of Art. It had a view to the Inwang Mountain, the mountain that appears in the painting of the best artist hundreds years ago. Watching far ahead to the mountain, put my self together, and opened a book. I memorized vocabulary, and read books. In two to three hours the sun began to come up above kiwa roof behind my seat. After watching the sunrise and feeling the temperature rising from warm to hot, I came home to prepare to go to work.
I looked into existing ideas and new ideas for a new portfolio, sorted out the best, made new models, wrote new comments, discussed them all with Shawn, a professor who taught me during my undergrad. I can’t thank him enough. He reviewed all my English writings and gave comments on even minor details. His comments on my visual works also greatly helped although his specialty was English literature. 
3 months rushed away, but every single moment was precious and full of meaning, vivid pain and culmination of delight. I can’t forget a small piece of sunlight touching on my right hand when re-writing the synopsis of my portfolio. It was beautiful yellow and orange coming through the high vertical windows of the wall to the far right. It was the sunlight before the sunset. Every time I went into and came out of the library, the sky was like a landscape painting. It relieved all my agony, gave me a certain conviction, and helped me forget the anxiety of future uncertainties. 
I did everything I could do for my applications to seven schools. Simultaneously, the time for decision was fast approaching. I now just knew how to make use of my time, that precious time in a valuable way. I knew I have something to do other than staying in the company. And I heard only what I was thinking. 
I listened to a podcast show which introduced The Man Who Walked through Walls by Marcel Ayme. In it was multiple short stories including Tickets for Time. It was a story of a man who purchased time with money. The other way around as well, sold time to earn money. The show host was famous Korean novelist, and was advocating a type of life where you are the owner of your time. You shouldn’t sell your time just to earn money, your time is much more than that he said. The show was a recording from a couple years ago, but he was talking directly to me in specific. That was the way I felt.














Surviving Diastrophism 
The First Diastrophism : COVID-19
The storm came to me in a totally unexpected way and at a totally unexpected time. I was assigned to a project based on Paris, France. I was supposed to travel there with my colleague, but our partner in a subsidiary office did not recommend us coming. It was not common that they comment on the trip. The reason was increasing hatred violence toward Asians in Paris. Behind the violence was the COVID-19, which was most likely originated from rural China. 
———
That was how I first heard of the pandemic. Days later business trips were all cancelled in entire divisions of the company. I didn’t care so much because I was more concerned with my time leaking away meaninglessly for nothing more than a salary. (Of course the salary is feeding me now, how grateful to myself then and there.) And I was waiting for the announcements from the schools with all my heart. 
Pandemic grew up its scale day by day. Now the questions were such as, will I be able to go abroad even if I qualify one of them? Could I begin my study, the long awaited study for which I stayed up a number of nights and dawns? Could I be able to even survive in the world of pandemic? Would I be able to live out of the National Insurance System for Employees?
Now I see these questions seem way too pessimistic. The world found its way to keep moving through whatever happened though it is suffering hard from the side effects especially in economy. I also figured out how to deal with groundless anxiety of the uncertainty of future. I can’t deny the change that I faced was huge without a doubt. 
If I quit the job I was going to spend time at a decent library where a complete classical pieces were thoroughly selected and displayed. Classics throughout different disciplines from physics, math, sociology, history, literature, etc. But I found it suddenly closed no way knowing when it would re open. Public, private or university libraries alike. Reading and writing was all I was thinking I was going to do. Thus it meant my plan should be withdrawn. 
Even cafes and museums were closed. The entire world just stopped its operation. And people were dying. Terrific number of people got infected by this virus and passed away just too suddenly. Borders were closed to control the spread of the virus. Visa was not issued anymore. Was it going to be the end of day? Yes or no, I could see nothing. Nobody knew what will happen even tomorrow, even today. I was scared and even hesitated to check out daily news. 
Good news was that I was accepted to an architecture school based in LA with scholarship - conditionally guaranteeing full tuition. LA was the least one where I’d thought I’d study in, but it was still great. It was only that there was no way to know what it’ll be like to study in this traumatic time. No guarantee of getting an F-1 Visa to move to the US. No way of knowing a smallest thing in my future. This tremendous uncertainty was something I’ve never experienced. Will the war time be like this? Again I thought of the old picture of post WW ll Tokyo or post Korean War Seoul in a history textbook. Or like Leornardo after a bear’s attack, buried in the earth. 
Still I didn’t withdraw my resignation. Thinking where there’s a change, there’s a way. And my will was where there was a change. A vague conviction. Looking back to the will of mine, it was more or less vague though it couldn’t be less firm. Vague but also  extremely solid conviction.

The Second Diastrophism: Digital Fatigue
The world slowly groped its way along the road not taken. Libraries repeated partial opening and temporary closing. Cafes to-go only and dine-in. Schools closed its campus and shifted to fully digital. Meeting on Zoom, presenting on Miro, sharing information on Teams. I was studying abroad living in Bukchon, an old city center of Seoul. 
It was pretty much painful to lose opportunity to mingle with peers in a new place. However, I gradually got used to the new way of remote learning. The first semester was surprisingly productive and inspiring. It just flied away. I went to school by turning on the laptop at 5:30 am and back home by turning off at 11am or 12pm. I made paper models, digital models, drawings, led team projects and wrote essays.
I spent the rest of the day at a co-working office, because I couldn’t do any productive work at home. Exhaustion, demotivation, I don’t know what it was that disturbed me to focus on my job at home. But the Wework made me move. It was perhaps the fact that I was conscious of consuming some money, or more lively, large, and open space gave me room for working. Seeing others into their job also must have helped. 
View on the top of the Jongno Building was the thing too. Later in the first semester, it snowed more often than it usually does in winter. Watching big snow flakes falling down, flying in the air along the flow of wind, and buildings farther away, and mountains far behind, and the horizon where the sky met the mountain. And beyond the mountain was myself - my inner scenery. I could see what’s happening in my mind, though not clear at all, which I couldn’t see in the apartment. What was worrying my, ideas I had, tasks I had this week, and lots of miscellaneous fragments of thoughts. It was something like watching a baby. It’s not that a baby does something special all the time, but it needs attention all the time. As a babysitter, it is a must to watch the baby. Otherwise a serious anxiety and worry will take over. It was repetition of watching far away and in turn inside myself for unknown time and then switching to working on assignments. 
—
The result of the first term was excellent, but the problem was the next semester. The school once again announced it would go fully remote that spring 2021. The pandemic situation was even worse than ever. Ok, I can keep working the same way. Taking lectures early mornings at home, working on assignments at a shared office. Let’s do it again, I can get over this. Let me get this, come on. 
It is funny how ridiculously easily one’s resolution breaks apart at times. It was just funny how I was sitting at the window side in the office for hours doing nothing. I couldn’t switch to working mode now. The switch was out of order. I had no idea what I was doing. With my laptop on at the desk, I just kept watching down outside to the left through the full glass wall. Frozen, skinny trees trembling in early spring chill looked like myself, frozen and isolated from the world. People walking fast with their coats and mufflers tight up to their neck. What was happening, I had no idea. 
I struggled to understand where I am and kept up with the curriculum. I left Seoul to Pohang where I was born and my parents are living. I could watch and smell the sea, run along the beach not far from the apartment. Maybe it wasn’t enough to refresh because back in Seoul in a month, I collapsed again. I was not able to control myself. I’ve never woke up that late. I missed lectures and assignments. I was not able to focus on the monitor. It seemed like a thick brick wall, so thick that I couldn’t get into. I could do nothing. 
It was obvious that my grade would end up terrible. Possibly subject to failing the term. What can I do if I fail the semester? It was like the end of the world. I also had alopecia areata. At a hair shop, the hair designer let me know there’s a round hole, about an inch, missing hair. It was shocking. I’ve never expected anything like alopecia areata would happen to me. 
It meant I was being tremendously stressed out. I’ve heard several people had it, and then I had thought why so stress yourself. It was a lesson for me that serious desperation can get you alopecia areata. There are times when you can’t control yourself knowing that you must do in order to avoid a huge rock. Then the best you can do is admit the collision to come and get yourself ready. Prepare yourself to minimize the impact of collision and recover quickly - but not too quickly if you don’t want to fall down for the same problem. 
Survival Strategy 1: Reading.
I thought about what I would do if it was my last day. Ridiculous enough, it was reading. Was I not serious about the question? I was serious. But the answer was reading. It sounds weird or absurd but it was the most reasonable and long awaited answer for me. I had an old list of books in my mind that I could find no time to read for unbearable amount of assignments. Travel and meeting my family was another option but I couldn’t. The pandemic was warning everyone to minimize long distance journey.
That reading list was one of the most important reasons I decided to quit my job. It was exactly the thing that I believed was worth spending my time. Funny enough, I wasn’t doing it at all even though I really quit and now had control over my time. Maybe I handed the control over to the school this time. It was exactly the same repertoire as before except only that the company was replaced by the school. 
The shipwreck of digital fatigue was not intended at all, but I decided to make it an opportunity to take the control back. I stopped panicking and sorted out the list of books. Adam Smith, T. S. Eliot, Jean Baudrillard, Le Corbusier, Robert Ventury, Norberg Schulz, Heidegger, Michel Foucault, and so on. 
I read everyday. No exception. I moved on regardless I understand it or not. I just kept reading. In that semester, the meaning of reading has changed. It sounds ironic, but reading had nothing to do with knowledge to me then. The act of reading itself was superior to what sort of knowledge I obtain or even whether I obtain any knowledge at all. I was desperate. In a couple of days, the act of reading became something like a shield for me to endure the anxiety coming from my future already all broken apart. 
Reading in the morning, I went out for a walk. A long, aimless walk. I walked around the old city center. I walked around the large and empty square in front of the gate to the old palace then closed for the pandemic. I watched mountains surrounding the palace from west to north. I saw the beauty of the mountains of Inwang and Bukak. I went to narrow streets where early 20th century brick buildings were standing in a row. Built after the Korean War, but those looked more attractive than latest high-tech sky scrapers. 
Another building in European style - the first Anglican Church designed and built by an English missionary. The style was a synthesis of traditional Anglican Church and Korean traditional roof system, Kiwa. Several smaller residential buildings in the campus were fully in Korean traditional style. The landscape of the church was absolutely beautiful. Perhaps anxiety makes the overhead sky look far more beautiful. 
Right beside it was a modern theater designed by a first generation Korean architect, Joong-up Kim. It seemed the theater was not in operation, but there was small offices in the building. One of them was a start-up co-work office. It was a lot smaller, cozier, than Wework, but the site was so beautiful. It was very cozy, neat, tidy, simple and modern. It also provided an hourly fee service while a monthly subscription was the only option in the Wework. 
It was far less a burden to use Jipmoosil than Wework, and I loved the location a lot better although it was pretty distant. So, I rode a public bicycle which was fantastic. Spending a couple of hour or more at Jipmoosil, and then getting back home by bicycle was my daily routine. The scenery on a  bike gave me a totally different sense than while walking. It felt free, light, and bright. 
From then on, between reading books, I came back to work on assignments, slowly, step by step. Flat, smooth empty hole on my scalp began to have several new strands of hairs again. 

The Third Diastrophism: Racism
Issuance of F-1 Visa began again in Autumn 2020. Vaccines were developed. They were effective although they could not eliminate all variants at once. It is impossible with any means. Emptying my apartment in Seoul I made a new housing contract in LA, booked a flight to LA and was vaccinated on time for flight. Second year of Master’s program was beginning. 
It was around that point. I had a strange feeling that there might be a sort of conflict, a kind of war coming up. That feeling should be arising from my experience of entering a new world - new periods in my life. In the first year at high school, there was a minor but personally life-changing school violence. At a college, in the army, in a workplace, there was always an unexpected conflict in the beginning.
So why not in LA? It is just surprising how various an obstacle can be. All happy families are alike, but every diastrophism is tough in its own way . I was preparing a design assignment for studio. What was bothering me was the way the instructor chose a word in a desk critique. He was a Argentinian architect practicing in LA. He used Asian symbolic figures or concepts as an analogy for something inferior, whenever he found something to criticize in my design work. Slamming my laptop was not at all a matter to him. 
My work was something like Xi Jinping as opposed to innovative Tesla CEO. Or like too simplistic like Yin and Yang, fundamental concepts that explains hidden  order of the world in ancient Chinese philosophy. Their position in a way corresponded to Plato’s idea and form in western philosophy. They were reinterpreted in Korea to be none dichotomous. They were also used as an element of the national flag design. 
I found it problematic that he kept using non-neutral vocabulary, his bias on Asia in general, and his ridiculous violence. It was disturbing me to focus on the assignment. So, I stopped working on it. And I decided to speak how his comments are problematic in class. 
Looking back I’d kept silent every time. Of course silence did not help overcome the conflict. I had to fall down to chaos and then take years to manage to overcome the chaos. So, if it happens again, I thought I would not be silent. I would speak out what is wrong, and how it is wrong. If there’s a single thing I need to prove that I was now a better person than before, that was having my voice on what I think was wrong. 
My voice just ruined the relationship with the instructor. Again, it was a self confirmation that far reduced scholarship would now be gone at all. That guy was a leading coordinator in control of three-fifths of credit total in that semester. I knew that grade matters in many ways, financially and in terms of career path. 
But what I’ve been doing for years was to compromise with what was wrong; in the name of white lies, strategic lies, flexibility. It wasn’t ethical problem, but it always bothered myself to feel like I was deceiving myself. It was compromise. Just accepting what is as is knowing there is a better way to do it. Sacrificing truth for the sake of pragmatic efficiency. It is a clever way of thinking and behaving. That is the way you live as an adult. 
Being adult means accepting the reality knowing it is not the best. Ok, so it goes. That happens. No surprise, that could happen. But, what could not happen if one keeps taking whatever happens in the name of reality. That way, war broke out, genocide, massacre happens. That way global warming keep accelerating sneakily. 
It was never a pleasant experience for me, but it certainly broadened my perspective on this multi cultural society. I never knew what it feels like to live as a minority. I never knew what it’s like to hear someone the other side on the street pass by murmuring ‘fuck off’ to me. What it feels like somebody with seriously blaming eyes on me spit on the way I am about to tread upon running on the street. What a shock it is that someone suddenly run toward me to snap my cellphone and push my shoulders off to the road and curse as hell, ‘go home stranger, go to your country!’. 
I lost many things by speaking out. The first four months in LA were just terrible like hell. Painful conflict with authority and loss of my rightful opportunity to learn. I do not regret though
because I gained just as much. 
The first I gained was extension of my social consciousness. Going though the conflict with the instructor throughout the whole semester was not an easy going experience. It was tough and at times felt isolated from majority. It was the first time for me to experience a true sense of minority. That should be why I came to put my hand on a magazine, People, in a library. Sandra Oh, a Korean American actress, was the cover model. I knew her but had never been interested in her. On that day, however, I found she’d been facing the same obstacle throughout her life as an actress. She acted roles that breaks a cultural and racial bias: the head of English Literature department in a college. She said she’ll keep fighting against those bias and especially latest hatred toward Asians. So I was not alone in this matter. And I was not wrong. There was no reason to doubt myself or be ashamed of my fight. 
My perspective on other issues also changed. In the magazine was an interview of Simone Biles, a legendary American gymnast. She was famous for her withdrawal from the final in Tokyo 2020 Olympics. It was to focus on her mental health, as she said, and I could now understand what that meant. I found that she was sexually abused by USA Gymnastics doctor, and she suffered from the twisties, a sudden mental block especially common among gymnasts. She exposed all those issues. She proved that there are more important values than the result. I could feel how she might have felt in those moments of difficulties, and how great her decisions were. 
I also realized a true greatness of a scholar and professor in UCLA, Jared Diamond, famous for his book, Guns, Germs, and Steel. The book explains the difference of cultural powers in terms of geographical conditions. It is very rational counterargument against latent but widespread bias of inherent superiority of a certain race or ethnicity. What really mattered was that his research was not intended to argue against a racial bias but purely to seek for the truth. 
—?
During the semester, it was at times confusing to distinguish between racism and empirical knowledge or inductive reasoning. For example, what is wrong to say that Asians are quiet and passive if statistically greater portion of Asians are introverted than other races? Isn’t it the right conclusion backed by a solid data? However, the violence comes from ignoring individual difference in the name of general tendency, which is not even absolutely trustworthy. I could now see racism lacks a will to seek for the truth. It disregards the exceptions for the convenience of defining or offending a racial group. 
The second was rather simple: the confirmation that I have my voice. I know how badly a violence can destroy an inner self of an individual especially when one keeps quiet about the issue for fear of revealing one’s pain or any sort of potential revenge or disadvantage. And it is quite common that victims regard opening the issue as evidence of their weakness although the truth is the opposite.
Some values are beyond the territory of benefit, monetary evaluation. Those values are authentic. They are founded on themselves. My voice was too. They are of unconditional value for my being. Of course they do not compensate for the loss in GPA or the amount of Financial aids.

The Fourth Diastrophism: Financial Crisis
Clever Enemy aims at Critical Weakness. Making an enemy of the world to me was not on my wishlist. But, I can’t help feeling the world seems so at times. 
I believe I’ve fought well against the pandemic, digital fatigue and racism. The pandemic is still going on and will be there. It is now pretty much controllable, though, and we don’t panic as seriously as we did in the first year. 
The whole world fought the pandemic in various ways. Quantitative easing was an economic strategy to overcome depression caused by quarantine and following reduction of consumption. The strategy was implemented worldwide, especially in large scale in the U.S. Inflation was taken as inevitable to follow the quantitative easing, and it is now the time. The greatest inflation in 40 years in the U.S and most of other countries all over the world. Russian war is exacerbating the situation further by failing global supply chain of food and energy sources. 
I thought I was financially prepared well enough to cover the tuition and living cost even if I lose my scholarship. But now, it’s even worse than I supposed then. It’s not only that I’m subject to losing my scholarship having trouble with a racist instructor and having been knocked down by digital fatigue, but also the inflation is raising the cost for everything that comprise my living, food, rent, traffic, insurance, etc. To make it even worse, the exchange rate soared from 1,100 to 1,400 won / dollar. 
I can do nothing about it, and those intangible unreal things that is out of my power has the most impact on my real life. It is terribly anxious and frustrating to check out daily exchange rate. Huge impotence overwhelms me.
I read. When I’m overwhelmed by the helplessness, I can do nothing but read. In a novel, The Wind up Bird Chronicle, someone says “You’ve gotta spend your money for the things that money can buy, not worry about profit or loss. Save your energy for the things that money can’t buy.” That is wise. Let’s not be silly to waste my mental energy for those that money can cover. Save it for things more important than money. But, what if I don’t have enough money to spend even for the things that money can deal with? 
Little income from the work study at school can do almost nothing. I’m also determined not to ask my parents for help. I want to be responsible for my decision to quit my job and begin the master in my mid 30s. As far as commonsense goes, it was never a timely decision. (Commonsense is hollow at times though.) Most of my friends and colleagues were preparing for marriage and earning more money for the future, though not all of them. 
What’s funny and ridiculous is that I am not studying for money. Funny and ridiculous. To think about it and seek for something like that, instead of money, seems too naive or unnecessarily serious in this world. Why so serious. Why so complicated. Why so naive. What’s more important than money, I mean there are surely several things of greater importance like family, love, dream, ethics, justice, and truth, but what can you do to pursue or protect them if you fall short of money? 
Perhaps two years so far was just good enough for me. Wishing for more time is greedy. Anyways, what did I study for then? It was just to write about what I wanted to write about, what lies behind my feeling.

Survival Strategy 2: Cooking
Accompanied with a rapid increase of exchange rate was changing my lunch menu. I began to make my own lunch box. The cheapest I can eat outside, except fast food, is not so bad chicken pesto caprese for $12, which actually tastes amazing. Or two pizza slices for $8, but they don’t last long before I feel hungry. My budget is not available for eating outside everyday. If I purchase ingredients and cook for my self, the cost for three meals a day can drop under $10. It is very economic considering the cheapest price for a single decent meal is $12 outside. 
I usually make a sandwich with white bread, an egg, garlic slices, spam or chicken breast roasted with extra virgin olive oil. It does taste good. A lot better and satisfactory than I first expected both qualitatively and quantitatively. For dinner I usually make vegetable tofu stew with beef or pork as a main dish. A pot of stew can serve more than 4-5 times sufficiently. Of course I have it with a bowl of rice. At times I cook chicken or beef soup, or roasted pork or beef. As frequently do I make noodles. Spaghetti, pasta, rice noodle, or instant spicy noodles. 
It always tastes better when I spend some time to cook. There’s certainly more to the slow food that can’t be fully described as ‘good taste.’ Let me try this way. I usually watch  YouTube, 10 minute clips or shorts that you can watch without any sort of thinking or that keeps you away from thinking. Then I don’t pay attention to the food or the act of eating. I just eat like an AI machine, as a machine is fed its electricity or its oil tank refilled. But, it’s a whole different story when I consciously spend time to prepare and cook each ingredient and to do plating with some care. 
The first time I made a sea food pasta here in LA, I found it made me ignore my iPad streaming a silly YouTube show. It never happened before. I turned off the screen and switched to music instead. One of classical one, not too grave. Then, I appreciated each spoonful of food. No doubt it tasted not as good as at a restaurant, but it was not important. The food that contained my time and my attention had something invisible but very solid, and that satisfied me in a different level than a mere taste. It wasn’t a mere satisfaction of my stomach. It was also filling a sort of spiritual hunger, fulfilling an empty and blank soul of mine. — I don’t like to use this word, soul, because it’s too vague and feels mostly out of reasonable context. I’ve never thought I knew what it means. But writing about the difference of the food I cooked myself, soul seems to be spot on. Just like a famous title, Chicken Soup for the Soul. Soul is not anything mysterious. It is a part of my everyday being.
This sense of abundance disappear when I sit at a table with an instant noodle quickly boiled up. I need my iPad in this case. Probably I am anesthetizing my sensory organs with those endless flow of visual stimulus, to silence their protest against the food that lacks proper care and the low quality of food soon to invade their territory. To say, the YouTube is an effective water canon or tear gas to suppress a rightful demonstration of my body. 
Thus I’d better care and take time to cook what I eat for metaphorical non-violence. Accordingly, my shelves and refrigerator is filled with mostly with healthy ingredients and a few instant foods. My enemy, if there’s any, would be laziness to wash dishes. This time, YouTube is a great antidote. When I turn on the video and start to wash dishes I just forget the fact that I am washing dishes. There’s no absolute evil. 

Survival Strategy 3: Today, not Tomorrow
*A new model of time: only today & within today. Far ahead is not visible for now. Today is the most clear. // Linear time - ex. plan of 5 years to come??, future detached from the present, all time points equally important as the present.  
Careful selection of ingredients and cooking reduces living costs and fill the spiritual as well as physical hunger. That is amazing, but not enough to stand fully against a huge storm of anxiety coming from a historical inflation severest in recent 40 years. 
The severity of this storm calls for more diverse combination of strategies. Negative strategies as well as positive ones. What not to do is as significant as what to do in this context. A lot of agony comes from the future that has yet to come, thus not actually existing at the moment. The fear that I may not find my way in the future yet. Uncertainty that I may or may not be able to make living in the future. Not knowing what would happen to me or to my family and whether I’d be prepared to deal with it or not. All these worries collide with my stability, shake my mentality, make me crack. 
When that happens, I try not to think of tomorrow and days after tomorrow. It is ironic that I very much consciously make effort to define those days to come as non-existent because they are actually non-existent. A man collapse as much by the threat of non existent risk as by actual risk. Anyways, I try to keep myself solely focused on what’s happening today. Today is the only time that exists. 
I usually know what I need to do today. I know what book I’ll continue to read and where I left off. I know why I chose that book - why I got interested in that book. That interest didn’t simply come out of nowhere, but was built upon my past readings. So, it really tells where I am though it never tells me directly how reading will lead to making living — but nope, I stop myself there. I stop whenever I violate the rule of presence. At least for today, making living is a matter of future, yet to come. 
Today’s reading tells me what to do tomorrow. It’s not only about the number of page where I stop today. Reading today, I obtain a sense of certainty that this book is worth continuing to read tomorrow. Or another certainty that I need to move on to another book or research related with a passage that struck me today. 
You could say that it’s similar to the process of natural evolution. A living organism doesn’t look like changing at all in a short term, say none today. However, at a certain point, there appears an unexpected mutant which at times totally change the direction of the evolution of the species. Most of days are quiet and boring just like mine. My todays. But, unexpected mutants will inevitably appear some day and show me the direction which I never knew today. 
This negative strategy of not-to-do is never easier than the opposite. Because I’m so used to doing SOMETHING to deal with a task. Doing nothing in order not to think of non-existent future is most likely to cause greater thoughts on it in reverse. It was proved in an experiment of psychology, they say to you ‘don’t think about an elephant,’ and it is then when your mind gets full of elephants trying not to think of it. 
Thus, the best way to act on this negative strategy is, again, to do something you can do here and now. Reading might be one of them, but it sometimes give you too much things to think about. Reading for a whole day might drive you to get crazy or excessively bored. Bodily activity is good for a proper balance with reading as a mental activity. In my case, it is swimming. I’d like to include yoga, which is closer to stretching in my case, but it has as much mental aspects as physical ones. Both of them greatly help focusing on today, not thinking of hallucinatory future worries.  

Survival Strategy 4: Swimming
The idea of swimming came from my daily routine of reading at the Central Library, just like a mutant along the path of evolution of a living organism called today. 
I always walked up the curvy stairs opposite to the Central library on my way home in the evenings. Then, a beautiful scenery of sky comes in sight colored orange by the setting sun. The dark green colored building of YMCA was always there but invisible for a long time before I discover it one day. I had always felt sorry that there was no swimming pool in downtown. It was also that I was not able to imagine the pool could be open if there were any because the pandemic was still going on. 
I began to swim in Korea since late December 2016. I’d never learned how to swim and was not willing to do, but it was unavoidable. I used to run, but there was a trouble in my ankle. I was diagnosed not to run for a while. Aerobic exercise was a must for me to organize myself, come up with an idea for my work, and deal with stress. Swimming was the best fit to replace running. I kept visiting a swimming pool every weekend to spend about 2 hours. However, the pool closed as the pandemic significantly worsened in February 2020. Since then, I switched to running again and never swam once. It was lucky that my ankle recovered, but I was sorry for pool closure. 
25 yard long pool of YMCA was awesome. Four lanes in total, and two persons max per a lane. I’ve never appreciated that spaciousness to the fullest in Korea. The Olympic Pool was a lot larger than YMCA pool, but every lane was even far more populated throughout a whole day. Each of 50 meter lane was usually filled with 7-8 swimmers. There was always a waiting line of people standing near the starting point. In the afternoon, the line got so long as to bother the traffic of swimming. 
It was mostly one way or the other; being chased by somebody faster or being stuck before someone too slow. It was very difficult to take my time, to take it easy. Looking back to those days, I think I was never able to get a grasp of my true pace. It might not entirely due to the excessive crowds. I was always exhausted from the beginning. 
I went to the pool with almost empty stomach but bearing a week-full of fatigue instead. Why was I in so much a hurry? Going early didn’t really guarantee less crowded pool. I was still in a hurry and I never skipped swimming, not even once. Damn crowded or not, swimming always made me feel better. To completely exhaust myself in the pool, take a shower and walk out of the stadium to feel the fresh air outside. To see the sun in the afternoon slowly walking through the Olympic Park watching families, friends, lovers having picnic on the lawn. 
What brings me to the pool either here or in Korea was that feeling after swimming. The water does an excellent job to wash away stain inside my mind. Be it anxiety, fatigue, anger or hatred - whatever drags me back - was gone as clean dishes. Then, I could get myself room for thinking of how to move on the next week. Here in LA, how to move on today. 
It feels somewhat miraculous that I always learn or correct something everytime I swim. And the fact that I take a step forward relieves my anxiety, which usually bothers me the most Monday morning. With a small achievement that others never recognize I walk out of the gym feeling anew. 0.001% of my full set of genes feel like replaced by new ones. That subtle sentiment is powerful enough to energize and motivate myself to dive in to the life of today. I open the lunch box and eat what I cooked, take time watching the street shining brightly under the Californian sun. 
The Sun in LA has a mysterious power. I’d have to say I’m a rather pessimistic than optimistic from the beginning. That should probably be the source of ever present sense of anxiety. Getting the sunshine, though, feels like changing my inherent characteristic as a strong pessimist. The sumptuous brightness in the exterior world just flourish to overflow into my deep and dark interior world. 
Two people become a swim partner for about an hour. As far as I keep to one side of the centerline, I have no worries to be chased or stuck by my partner. I can keep my pace here. Meaning I can get a more clearer picture of my true self here, and in what level I am in as a swimmer.
In the pool, I sometimes exchange greetings with anyone sharing a lane. I’ve never done so in Korea. Perhaps this cultural difference in greeting comes from the size of land. In a country like Korea, excessively dense population, people are always exposed and surrounded by strangers. Even light physical contact, such as bumping shoulders, is nothing special for some people. In this environment, it can’t be the most pleasant thing to encounter others. We are already encountering hundreds of random people without knowing it. — In contrast, imagining long time ago in a vast territory of US, it must be a very delightful to encounter someone in hours of driving. Encountering somebody is an incident that really counts. That might be as rare as a Korean encounter an acquaintance by chance on the street. Thus average Koreans exchange greetings only with acquaintances while Americans with whoever they encounter on the road.
Back to swimming, I found I was barely a beginner. When it comes to long distance swimming, a mile in 50 minutes is a baseline of beginner according to a book I read at the library. I qualified myself as an official beginner only lately. Becoming an official beginner in 3 years of weekly 2 hour swimming may not be the most efficient progress. But who cares? Stroke forward, learn a thing at a time and leave a simple note on the daily learning. 
These are more than enough to remove the stain in my mind and soothe my nervous mind. 

Survival Strategy 5: Meditation
“Thought is conversation with oneself.” wrote T. S. Eliot. So is Meditation for me. 
On a day I swim, my body feels warmer. After cooking for myself to have dinner, I sit still on a yoga mat around sunset. I put off a T shirt, and feel the warmth emitting from my body. Yoga might not be the best way to call this ritual or habit. For one thing, I have never learned yoga. For another, all I do is just sitting still and a set of typical stretching. But more precisely speaking, what I am doing behind the bodily actions is a silent conversation with myself. 
In the past, I used to watch random videos on YouTube after dinner. It was a sort of treatment to blind my sight, to close my eyes and take a break. Sometimes I encounter very useful and interesting information. Other times, I just kill my time wondering around meaningless and endless flow of images. There was something that made me irritating at times. Not clear what it was though. 
If I have to explain, it would be something like an anxiety, again, this time coming from my blindness of what’s happening around myself or inside myself. Youtube seems like an eye mask. The mask would feel like super glued on my eyes at times. Sitting on a yoga mat was a means to an end of uncovering it. Turning it off was so difficult, but once done, sitting on the floor gave me exceptional calm and peace. Once I sit on it, I could begin to watch and listen to what was happening both inside and outside of myself. 
My first meditation was by my mom’s recommendation. My early 20s was an absolute mess. I knew nothing about what to do. Not a slight hint of hope but entire chaos. I was an outsider in a college where I was studying fine art. I belonged nowhere. Perhaps my mom noticed I was having a hard time that she recommended it. First a couple of time by the recommendation, I felt it was not bad. Occasional meditation then became one of my solid habit after encountering a book, Being Peace by Thich Nhat Hanh. 
“Sit there, stop, be yourself first, and begin from there. That is the meaning of meditation.”
He taught me I was already arriving here. “Look deeply: every second I am arriving. Do not say I’ll depart tomorrow — even today I am still arriving.” I realized I don’t need to depart to anywhere else. This is the place I’m supposed to arrive. I was already arriving at the place where I was supposed to be. It was relieving and even emancipating, but easy to forget. Due of daily tasks, noisy media, crazy ads, breaking news… so many things make it fades away so soon. Meditation helped me remember that important truth. 
As all might expect, sitting still and stretch muscles have not so much fun in them. Nevertheless, a couple of hours quickly pass , or at times 3-4 hours when longer. It is interesting that there are unlimited number of stimuli that, unlike YouTube clips, don’t let you feel bad even if you pay attention for hours. Weakness of them in comparison with YouTube is that those analog physical stimuli are simply weaker. Weaker in volume of sound and visual attraction . Competition seems meaningless. 
But after focusing on them sitting on a mat did I realize; What was lying beyond the sensual stimuli was never lighter despite of its relative weakness. For example, I heard something like a firework occasionally from several blocks away. In ten minutes or so, a notorious siren running across the street gradually getting smaller to the direction of the firework. This combination of sounds repeated almost daily for a week last summer when it became dark outside. I realized it was not the sound of firework, no way at all. 
The sound of gunshot is unique in a way that its loudness has textile impulse rather than auditory one. I experienced that serving in the Korean army where I got training for shooting. It is a sound, but that sound is more like an auditory version of tearing off a delicate transparent fabric of air. It doesn’t have anything to do with the distance of the sound. Far or near, that sound tears off the air anyways. Skid row area in DTLA is infamous as a slum where homeless and drug dealers populates. Sounds were gunshots in the area and perhaps the following siren of 911 either to save a victim or arrest a criminal. 
To say, this sort of listening is active listening. I find myself questioning and guessing what is behind the physical sounds. I listen to the voice of myself questioning and guessing. My voice speaks to myself even when there is no external sound of shooting or siren. Maybe it is a stream of unconsciousness. The mute voice of thoughts are there waiting to be heard. Giving attention to fragments of words flowing inside myself, or listening to mute voice of my inner self — That is what yoga means to me.  
Thoughts that look back on what I did, what happened today, how I feel, what I need right now, what is bothering me. Carefully listening to the thoughts sometimes feels like cleaning a messy room because it makes floating thoughts to sink and stay still on the ground of my mind. I grab them and categorize them as if categorizing a bunch of fishes caught in ocean. This abstract process is accompanied by stretching my muscles. 
I stretch my arms and legs very slowly. Most of them were very tense and stained. I try to lengthen the tense muscle. I am especially cautious not to hastily use the power of my own muscles. Instead I use the weight of my body parts. It’d be better to say I wait for the gravity pulls my body parts stretch themselves slowly throughout time. That way, I can observe those muscles, that weren’t likely to loosen at first, loosens in some time. In turn I find my body getting more flexibly. They stretch and fold in greater degree and joints feel softer. 
This is the way I wrap up todays. This way I can get a glimpse of the image of a new today that tomorrow will become tomorrow. I get a hold of myself that keeps trying to fly further away to figure out the uncertainty of the day after tomorrow. That should be the work of a new today which is yet tomorrow. 





















Platonic Pandemic: Part 2. Thinking
Prologue
A Thought Ignited by a Watch
So, I think of time today, too. Time is everywhere and nowhere. Most of time, it reveals itself through the form of clock or watch or simple combinations of numbers on your phone. What is time, then? It took some time to figure out that a timepiece is not the totality of what time is. 
What is time? That was the initial question, and it led me to the realm of space. Just any sort of space where things are scattered around, some alive and others inanimate. Other than the tangible devise of clock or watch, I found, time doesn’t have its physical presence. What are actually there are things and its surrounding space. What’s important is that there’s motions of things. Time is an abstract concept that derives from the motions of substance in space as Aristotle said. 
Imagine there’re all these things but no motion at all. Every single thing in the world is frozen and is going to be frozen forever. No breath coming in or out, neither molecular level of movement, nor even the least degree of quantum electro dynamic change. Nothing ever changes. Entropy also doesn’t change. In that kind of static world, what does time exist for? Nothing. In order for time to exist, things have to be there and have to change in any way beforehand. Time is all about change at last. 
Night Chess, everyday, 5:30 - 7:00 pm. At the central library of Los Angeles. What this means according to the definition of time? The Earth rotates on its own axis. Dividing a single rotation into 24 phases, every time the orientation of the Earth faces a certain direction, people in the library gather to play chess.
The earth’s motion in accordance with the sun and moon is at the center of the standard of the familiar concept of time in our everyday lives. The length of an year, month, day, an hour, a minute, etc. Four seasons, day and night, just everything. 
Time is a concept deriving from a motion of a specific object, in this case, the earth. But it doesn’t always have to be. Theoretically speaking, the earth was chosen for multiple reasons. Any objects that has any sort of motion can be an origin of time.
The Earth repeats the same motion again and again. It revolves around the Sun, and it rotates on its own axis. That’s it. Always at a regular interval on the same orbit. It will go on forever as far as the sun keeps burning and no collision happens. The motion of the Earth just perfectly fitted the need of the modern industrial era. (Zeitgeist)
The industrial era needed people to behave as if they are the Earth. Lots of laborers to come to work at a factory on time, and repeat the same routine everyday. They were taught and educated that way. A good boy always gets up early and is never late for school. Meanwhile, a clock was marching for a perfect tracking of the motion of the Earth.  Eliminating an error was the ultimate pursuit. More accuracy, longer consistency, less error meant greater value. 
Telos, an ideal pursuit of an age was already in the order of nature of planets. To realize the ideal by representing it perfectly was the pursuit of the age. Being identical with an ideal order was the key. In the society, conforming to - obeying - the given regulation was the key. Eliminating the error, eliminating personal difference. 
The earth was at the center of the concept of time, and the mode of life. In the mechanical level, strictly and ultimately speaking, the perfect identity was something that can’t be accomplished in reality. The sublimity of the craftsmanship of Swiss watch makers came from the fact that they chased what can’t be reached, an absolute precision. 
However, what was impossible in physical world is made possible in digital methods. Digital clocks are free from physical resistances. Perfect accuracy is nothing impossible now. The spirit to march toward the impossible perfection lost its aura. (Although we all still recognize the value of mechanical clock trying to overcome the physical resistance.) Like a gun made the weight of life much lighter than it was in the age of blade and arrow. It became just too easy to take away the life from a person. Moving a pointing finger about an inch is enough.
The work considered as sublime in traditional epoch is so tedious in new age, which as a new paradigm and value system. 
So it goes in (Here comes the next level.) the Digital Era.  
The Earth is just one of many objects as candidates for the source of time. What if an individual replaces the Earth? By individual, I mean someone like you. No, a person can’t be the source of time. But, that’s because of the age old traditional bias on what time should be like. The Earth oriented time was so popular and powerful so far. Individual time is already here though. 


Abstract: Platonic Pandemic
Pandemic Whiplash

Pandemic is an outbreak of a disease prevalent over a whole country or the world. (New Oxford American Dictionary) Began around early 2020, the COVID 19 is still largely populating. Now, lethality decreased by effective vaccines, but it caused more than six million deaths out of five hundred million infections so far. The fatality of pandemic accelerated digitalization: as means to overcome the spatial barrier of quarantine. It worked hard to keep the world moving on from a distance. 
The pandemic pushed the potential of digital technology to its limit — way far beyond the convenience driven activities like online shopping. It was tested to accommodate activities such as working and learning. Until recently, right before 2020, those were firmly believed to be desirably physical if not essentially. Now working from home and remote learning is relatively wide spread as an available option. #1
It’s not only Zoom meetings; AI, metaverse, self-driving car, block chain, Bitcoin… A bunch of new technological innovation is coming up to all field in this society.

Go Deeper, Take Broader Perspective
It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The 
mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible. 
Oscar Wilde, in a letter

We live in the age of phenomena. Enchanting superficiality is never too light hearted or shallow but virtuous. Breaking news announcing uncommon phenomena had flourished and it was all about visible phenomena. Tens of thousands of people passed away for a day. Hospital is full of patients of infectious disease. Temporary medical center appears everywhere, parking lot, gym, school, etc. Such and such countries closed its border banning entry. People are officially ordered to keep in their houses. A number of shops closes temporarily and then for ever in a couple of months. 
Influenced by the pandemic directly or indirectly, eye catching stream of change flourishes lately. Innovative companies do not require employees to be present in the office. #2 More and more workers are having freedom from fixed work hours benefiting from flexible work hour policy. Spatial and temporal restrictions are now turning into an individual choice. Tons of images are created and thrown away on social network platforms. Texts are also overflowing — deeply personal impressions that’ll last only a few seconds on a scroll. Museums are full of incomprehensible grotesque artworks. Tools are getting multi functional and its form  more unique or grotesque free from its function.  The price of crypto currency soars and drops in an excessively short period. And on and on. 
These novel, eye-catching phenomena look fragmental and arbitrary. However, those are settled within the historical and spatial context. Those fragmental incidents can be better understood when we look into the contexts. One way to look deeper is to look back to the past. #3 History always gives us a teaching. Another is to take a look at the whole picture beyond a partial frame. Expanding the perspective on phenomena leads us to a unified stream being driven by digital technological innovations. Interdisciplinary observation gives us a structural understanding of these phenomena by means form and content analysis. Diachronic observation reveals a sort of paradigm shift of value system throughout time. 

Digital: Metaphysical Pandemic —Fatal to Traditional Values
Expanding perspective on the latest digital innovations means studying its metaphysical impacts. Digital puts an end to traditional value system. The telos of traditional era is fulfilled in the digital space and in turn the telos in the physical space gives way to a set of novel values. #4
Digital technology causes platonic concepts to death. Traditionally dominant values such as idealism, universality, eternality, institutional value, unity provided each field with direction toward an ideal destination. These are aspects of platonic concept of idea that are fundamentally unachievable in a physical reality. However, digital technology transcends barriers to achieve these goals. And the accomplishment ironically gives them a fatal blow. Those platonic conceptions fade away. Then, old platonic ideas give way to a novel value system: realism(rooted in reality), specificity, temporality, individual value, difference and diversity. 

Where are We?
Different from the signs and objects, this platonic pandemic is not yet fully ripein space-time. AI, VR and self driving is still developing. These are potentially achieving traditional ideal of perfectly functional space and non time consuming mobility. #5 This achievements of digital technology are concerned with means  space. This change in means space is expected to accelerate the expansion of end space. Then, function driven means space and traditional values embedded in it is being replaced by existence driven end space containing novel values.

Assumption and Methods
Overview
According to Marchall McLuhan , every age has its favorite model of perception and knowledge that is inclined to prescribe for everybody and everything. Before him, Hegel insisted the presence of similar model that defines each age; everything real is with hindsight determined by organizing principles, and those hidden principles gives each epoch a kind of telos, an ultimate aim, a directionality to move forward. 
Based upon their ideas, and considering significant impact in various levels of digital revolution, it would be plausible to expect that digital era differs from traditional era in its identity and value system. The unique spirit of digital era represent itself through objects, signs and conception of space-time — as a coherent system in contrast with that of traditional objects, signs and conception of space-time. #6 The purpose of this writing is to reveal those coherent aspects by analyzing form-content structure of time, objects, signs and space. 
Observation of Phenomena: Time — Objects, Sign & Space-time
Objects as artificial physical entity is going to be discussed in two categories: those of use value and exchange value. Signs as an intellectual abstract product for communication will include images as visual sign and text as linguistic sign. Space-time is multi-faceted. Simultaneously both object and sign, but it is more than the sum of those two. 
Analyzing Structure: Form and Content. 
Objects and signs comprise two different elements; form and content. As for physical objects, form is literally the form, physical presence, and the content is its function. As for language, form is the signifier, and content the signified or meaning. As for image, form is visual material, and content what it represents or its meaning. There are other parallel areas that can be broken down into form and content. One of them is media and message in communication field. #7 The other is representation or replication and the original. 
Value system in Structural Level
The telos of the traditional period, or pre digital era, was universality of form and content and unity between form and content. Universality of form can be achieved by means of abstraction and simplification. Universality of content comes from truth and fact. Unity between form and content is defined as an ideal one-to-one correspondence. In this sense, there is a single case of unity while there are multiple cases of disunity. Qualitatively speaking, in the traditional period content was superior to form. Content was regarded as essential while form as superficial. Proper media needed to be sorted out for proper delivery of a message. Form was supposed to follow function. Image was representation of the original. #8
Digital technology is transcendental in two ways. It consummates the telos of traditional period and provides a new era with new telos. So, in the new era, form can stand without content, the same form can have multiple content, or same content can have multiple form. Unity between the form and content is not the mandate anymore. Form is equally or more valued as content. There is no singular ideal model. Here, the telos is specificity of form and content. Form can be anything however complex or personal, and content goes beyond the boundary of universal truth to as far as fantasy or personal trivia. 
Value system in General (Ideology, Zeitgeist): TBD
Diversity based on individual and contextual difference is virtue now.











TIME 
Introduction
#Made-up Conception of Time (Fabrication of Time)
Time does not exist. Time is only a human conception. #9 We always talk about time, and we always check out a watch or a clock. So, it is not odd to think that time exist. But, that something is visible does not always mean that it physically exist. 
#What Lies Behind Time: a Changing Thing
“Time is a measure of change.” wrote Aristotle. Time is a conceptual tool that measures change of substance that actually exists. Without change in material world, time is meaningless. Time would have not been there from the beginning. But lots of things do change. Those have always been changing from the beginning. Time derives from that change. #10
The fact that time does not exist makes it difficult and vague to talk about time. Time is a conception always based upon a changing object. Thus to talk about time is fundamentally not different from to talk about the object. Hidden origin of time is a changing object. 
#What Represent Time, What Replicates a Change
What reveals the invisible time is a watch. A watch let us know what time it is. It represents time, which means it represents the change of an object. Discussing the source of time where the conception of time derives and a representational tool of time, rather than discussing non existent time directly, can make a discussion more concrete and clearer but it’s also essential that we are aware of what exactly we are talking about. 

Traditional Age
#Phenomena: the Earth as Source of Traditional Time
An ordinary perception of time is rooted in the movement of a planet, the earth. A year is the length of time for which the Earth revolves 1 full circle around the Sun. #11 A day is the length of a single rotation of the Earth around its own axis. A day, an hour, a minute, a second are more minutely split units. So, when we say Usaine Bolt ran 100m in 9.58 seconds, it means that he ran 100 meters while the Earth moved 9.58 x 1/365x24x60x60 portion of its orbit of revolving around the Sun. 
#Phenomena: a Watch as Representation of Movement of the Earth
The conception of time based on the Earth’s movement replicates the aspects of the Earth’s movement. The orbit of the Earth is reduced into a circular form of a watch face. The size of the orbit is scaled down to fit on a wrist. The amount of angle is magnified from 360 degrees a year to 360 degrees per hour. 
#Phenomena: Lifestyle and Society
In the modern education and labor system, students and workers are ordered to move to a certain place, stay there by a certain time by authorities. Individuals share a collective identity by their obedience to the regulation. Much of difference between people is removed by the obedience to external regulation.  
#Structure: Single Form, Single Content
A traditional watch has only one function; tracking only the movement of the Earth. Fundamentally its form is designed to best fit and implement the function. Its function determines basic conditions of its form. 
#Traditional Value System: Identity
The movement of the Earth is fixed and unchanging. It works indiscriminately to every people, independent on the location or the flow of time. #12 It is eternal and universal. 
Virtue of this conception of time is precision. Precision supposes the existence of an original flow of time as a criteria to judge how precise a replica of it is. When the time a watch represents is identical with the original flow of time, it is described as precise. The more precise and accurate, the better. The less the difference between the actual time and measured time, the better. The price and fame of Swiss watch comes from its exquisite and lasting precision. 
In this value system, the standard of judging what is good is the movement of the Earth. It is a singular inanimate object that exist in an external world. A human being who actually perceives and measures the time has nothing to do with the standard. #13 Eliminating difference to accomplish perfect identity with the Earth, the external origin of goodness, is the telos of traditional age. 
The value system of human behavior resembles that of human perception of time based on the earth’s movement. Obedience to the external standard was the virtue of human behavior in traditional world. Obedience supposes one party has central authority to give an order or make a regulation, and another party to accept and adjust their behavior to follow the regulation. Deviation from the regulation is labeled as abnormal or wrong. 
Transcendental Technology
#Consummation of Digital Watch, but with a Trick of Electron
Strictly speaking, even the greatest Swiss watch still contains error because physical laws influence its physical parts. Friction between toothed wheels, resistance by the air molecules and dusts. The speed of a clock gets minutely slower. So, the user need to correct the difference at a regular interval. The physical limits of mechanical watch can be resolved when its parts are replaced by electric signals. #14
Electric signals are free from physical restraints. As far as battery is provided it keeps the same speed. Perfect replication of the movement of the Earth, perfect identity with the original time is achieved in digital watches. No need to make so complicated mechanical system. It is now just too easy to be accurate. Majority of cheap digital watch is more accutate than a mechanical watch however expensive it is. 
Digital Age
#Phenomena: an Individual & a Smart Watch — “a Device of New Zeitgeist”
Time is a conceptual product of human perception of material change. While the traditional notion of time was based off of the Earth in pre digital era, a novel perception of time is rooted in the movement of an individual. An individual is a specific and unique, animate and transient, more irregular being. #15 They have various kinds of movements unlike the Earth having limited ones such as rotation and revolution in macro level. Lastly, the source object of time, a human, itself is simultaneously a subject that measures time.
When the source of the perception of time changes, the way that people understand and interact with time also changes. Before moving on to that, it helps better understand a new concept of time to keep in mind that units of time is fundamentally spatial. An hour is no doubt a temporal unit, but fundamentally it would be meaningless without its spatial implication; it is the time equivalent of 1/24 of the Earth’s single rotation around the Sun. It can be redefined by other regularly moving objects such as an atom, a molecule or a pendulum. It still holds that a unit of time is based on a spatial distance during which a moving object moves. 
Now, the point is that the quality of movement entirely changes in case of an individual. A person walks, swims and does push-ups and sit-ups. Breathing and heartbeats continue without conscious effort. #16 These are basic and repetitive kind of movements of an individual. There are more irregular, complex, non-repetitive, even non-definable movements as well. Stretching, kicking a ball, sliding, hugging, crying, laughing, etc. 
Take breathing, walking and heartbeat for example. A single breathing has different lengths of time by individuals. It also differs by an occasion. It is shorter when running and longer when sitting still. Longer for adults and shorter for children. It is not just quantitative difference. The quality of breathing is not always constant. The portion of O2 coming in and CO2 going out always varies depending on the environment and one’s lung condition. #17 Likewise in walking. Time for taking 10 steps differs by the situation and who you are. The length of each step varies as well. Heartbeat is unconscious motion of our body, but it also varies by person and context. It changes by one’s physical and mental condition: health level, emotion, stress, given capacity of a heart, etc. 
We don’t use these irregular personal time units for the same purpose of the earth-based absolute time. We can not because new time units are all specific to an individual person.  For example, when I say to my friend ‘let’s meet after walking 2000 steps,’ then it is not at all likely that the meeting will occur in the most organized way. My remark is basically not so different from saying ‘let’s meet after 2 hours.’ #18 To spatially interpret this appointment, it is not different from saying that ‘let’s meet after the Earth walks 2000 steps.’ For sure supposing the earth has feet and its single step accounts for the distance that it moves for 2/2000 hours. Irregularity of time comes from the quality of a source object, a human, just like regularity of time from that of the Earth. Ordinary time works the same way to all and is capable to serve as a social tool to interact with other people; making an appointment to meet a friend, arranging a job interview, booking a movie ticket, etc. 
However, personal time - measure of change based on the movement of an individual - is more for an individual purpose. It benefits the owner rather than social activities. The owner is simultaneously the subject of measuring time and the object being measured. Tracking my 2000 steps of walking matters in different way than tracking 2 hours of the Earth’s movement. It reveals the level of my well being and fitness, and can potentially work as data to enhance it. 

More and more  companies are promoting the spread of flexible work hours. What lies behind this is belief that each individual is different and has its own best productive time. Trend of independency on traditional uniform public education is getting stronger at school. They do not follow the given schedule by the educational institutes. They set up and follow their own schedule and program. Home schooling population has consistently been increasing, and the increase was especially sharper since the outbreak of pandemic.

https://www.thinkimpact.com/homeschooling-statistics/
#Value System: Interactivity. 

The quality of interaction differs between traditional time and new time. #19 The relationship between the object and time is not oneway, but interactive. The Earth based time never has any impact on the Earth. However, an individual based time has potential to cause change in the movement of an individual. A smartwatch reflects the novel conception of time in its functions to track and record the exercise data of a user. It records the user’s breathing and sleeping, distance and pace of walking and running, counts of different weight liftings and check the heart rate. These data of novel conception of time influence the quality of the user’s movement, to say, life in general. He may aim to enhance the fitness level based on the previous record. She may go to see a doctor noticing her heart rate is abnormal in the morning. A smart watch helps the owner be aware of qualities of his/her own unique motion and improve them.  
#Structure: Single Form, Variable Content
A smart watch has multiple functions; tracking various movements of a user. Its form doesn’t have stereo type as traditional watches have. Different brands, Fitbit, Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Xiami, have their own very unique design of products. The difference of size and shape among those brands are far broader than the difference between traditional watches. The form is not fully confined by the function in it. 
#Value System: Changeability.
The conception of time based on an individual replicates the aspects of the movement of an individual. It is not consistent but constantly changes. Thus, no measurement is final because the unique individuals keep changing its mode of motion both consciously and unconsciously. #20 Inconsistency and change is taken as granted. 
#Value System: Individuality, Difference, Diversity. 
The new value system of human behavior shares aspects of an individual’s movement. Individuals are all inherently unique. Preserving and enhancing individual difference replaces obeying to the whole for collective unity.
The novel perception of time is neither fixed nor indiscriminate. There are innumerable kinds of time (time as a measure of change or movement) for each individual instead of a singular time that counts for all. Accuracy still matters, but it is not the most important thing but just a functional means for something of greater significance. It is accuracy to reveal the difference between individuals. Perfect replication is not the ideal destination. Every moment of time is part of a process and will forever be a process. Each and every steps of process is valued as much as final consequence. 
#21
[transition]
Whether mechanical or digital, a watch is a representation of time — a replication of a motion. To put it differently, we can say a watch has a function of representing time. Talking about a watch was ultimately to discuss time. So a watch was just a means that helped us to discuss the time despite of its vagueness. Now we are going to discuss an object itself and digital impacts in the territory of artificial objects. Majority of artificial objects are designed for a purpose or function. 

OBJECTS
+ Brief summary 
Introduction
Artificial objects have two types of values. Use value and exchange value. Again, objects of use value is categorized in two by a type of function; physical function and digital function.  The physical form of an equipment was determined by its function. #22 Drilling of a drill, writing by a pen, cutting by knife, mobility of a car are examples of physical functions. Digital functions are, for example, calculation of a calculator, word processing of a computer, photo taking of a smartphone, etc. Digital functions only accompanies microcosmic electronic process but not macrocosmic mechanical motion. 

Objects of Use Value
Traditional Age
#Phenomena: Knife, Car and Watch
What is a good knife? A knife that cuts well and easy. Cutting well is concerned with effectiveness of consequence. Cutting easy is concerned with efficiency of procedure. What is a good car? A car as fast as possible and with optimum energy efficiency. Likewise, a good watch is an accurate and long lasting one. #23 Form develops in two directions towards an Ideal Form for an Ideal Function. First, adding elements that helps better achieve the ideal performance of function. Second, reducing the superfluous element inessential for an ideal function. 
Basically, a perfect accomplishment of a primary physical function has not been made possible. (Efficiency level is a means to an end in the effectivity level.) Take a cutter for example. Perfectly straight cutting is realistically not possible. Perfect cleanness where no dust is at all can’t be realized by a cleaner even in a special laboratory facility. A car as fast as a light cannot be made in reality. An analog watch inevitably have minute level of error all the time.
#Structure: Form and Function
Function determines form. What is function? Primarily, it means practical performance of an object. It is an ideal image that people have in their mind. In that sense function is detached from reality. Physical form is designed as to realize the ideal image in a perfect identity in reality. What deviates from this is secondary function as Baudrillard defines. This is the point where aesthetics, automation, ergonomics begin to work together with the practical primary function to define the form of an object. Perfection does not hold in this level of secondary function because these are highly dependent on a subject. Still, primary  function is the dominant factor that drives formation of an object. #24
#Value System
The virtue of traditional functional objects was to get as closer to the image of an ideal function in primary level. Better realization of the ideal image of function is a pursuit of a perfection. The real was meant to replicate the ideal. One to one correspondence held between a perfect form and an ideal function. 
Transcendental Technology
#Digital Function - Computation
The territory of function expands with the appearance of digital technology in 20th century. Digital function means intellectual tasks electronically processed that produces an outcome on screen. Any type of computing devices count. Digital functions do not accompany a physical motion in macrocosm. Instead, it works electronically in microcosmic level. For example, electronic power source does not qualify as a digital functional tool because the digital part, the power source, implements only supportive role for its primary function. #25 The essence of an AI cleaner is still a physical cleaner for the purpose of physical cleanliness. 
Computational functions are different from physical functions in nature. A physical function is continuous, but computational one is discontinuous. Digital functions take place within an artificial setting, which is set upon discontinuous numeric value. A camera takes a photo image of an object within its pixelated system. The light elements of physical vision can be captured and stored in a given number of pixels. So, perfect accomplishment of a function becomes achievable in digital tools. For example, strictly speaking, on a hand written paper or even printed paper, perfect alignment of paragraphs is not possible. But, it is possible in a word processing software on a screen before it is physically printed.
Digital Age
#Phenomena: Customization 
Physical form of an object breaks free from the obligation to better implement a primary function. #26 Personal subjective preference replaces the position of a primary function. Secondary function gains greater emphasis in designing an object. In result, physical form of objects become more diverse. Primary function still determines fundamental forms of an object. For example, a display of a digital device such as a smartphone is always flat except for minor exceptions of slightly curved ones for its viewing performance. But ornamental elements as material choice and finishing matter more than ever. And the case details all vary between products because the visual language has to define a brand identity in a market. Especially in case of a software, room for personalization has been widened. Operating system of laptops and mobile devices provide customizable interface — wallpaper, menubar, arrangement of icons, font, etc. This is different from customization of physical objects. #27 
It is true that some physical objects, such as a car, provide various personalization. However, that personalization is done by external elements separate from the object itself; stickers, taping, engraving, etc. It contrasts digital software in the sense that personalization is embedded within the software itself. Thus, personalization in digital level is essential wh ereas it is inessential in physical objects as Baudrillard mentions in his book, the System of Objects. 
Baudrillard 142. The sole way to personalize cars is for the manufacturere to take a serially produced chassis, a serially produced engine, then change a few external characteristics or add a couple of accessory features… A car cannot be presnoalized in its essence… only inessential level…                                             In addition, digital tools are customizable anytime and as mush as users wants. But, customizing physical tools are rather restricted by time and cost. 
#Phenomena: Individual Creator
Applicaition markets flourish with functions developed by broad range of individual developers, who are users at the same time, as well as big scale software companies.
#Structure: the Feast of Form
A driver and a computer. A screw driver is destined to have a certain form whereas a computer can invent its own form. #28
Types of correspondence of a form and a function also extends. Traditionally, a single physical form contained and was governed by a single function. But, computational tools have multiple soft functions; editing a document, calculation, drawing a picture, taking photos, sorting out a set of data, sending emails, and so on.         
#Value: Versatility and Multi Player
Individual users gain greater power in digital era. They decide what for to use a digital tool. They decide how to decorate their software interface. Depending on their needs, a laptop becomes a typewriter, a video game, a voice recorder, a camera, a phone, and much more. 
In digital realm, perfect performance of a function is now no difficulty at all. What matters in making a new tool is personal needs and subjective taste of formal design. #29 A tool for a single ultimate function gives way to a multi functional digital tool that satisfies changing needs of an individual by context. 
In addition, the territory of producer-consumer also changes. Some users take the role as a producer of functions by creating applications. A specialized manufacturer produced physical functional tools in traditional age. Consumers just passively consumed the products. In digital age, however, the territory of those who produce a digital software dramatically expands. 
** Still, digital tools are produced by limited high tech manufacturers equipped with huge physical infrastructure as far as its hardware parts go; LED, semiconductor for memory and processor, etc. For software as well, Developer Kit should be distributed by operating platform owning company for individual developers to make an application. These might lead to risk of fake diversity. 

Objects of Exchange Value
Money itself is not valuable. #30 It is a small piece of paper or metal. It gains value by an agreement of exchangeability with other objects of use value between members of a society. 
Traditional Age
#Phenomena - Structure - Value
There are many kinds of currency; Dollar, Won, En, Peso, Wyan, Euro, Pound. 
Money represents a certain amount of material value. 
The telos of traditional currency is convenience of exchange. Exchanging monetary value with anybody, anytime and anywhere beyond the temporal and spatial barrier was the ultimate aim. Materiality of money and difference between currencies of countries were major barriers of achieving more convenient exchange of goods. Spatial and temporal constraints results from these aspects of traditional money. Transaction had to accompany the exchange of material form of currency, which was valid only in specific territory and took time for moving the money.
Transcendental Technology
#Global Online Financial Market
Dollar based worldwide digital financial market achieves the telos of the traditional age. Dollar works everywhere as far as market economy and digital financial system works. Digital banking eliminates materiality of traditional money replacing it with abstract numbers on screen. #31 Worldwide online financial system makes it available for any amount of money to move anywhere anytime. 
In the traditional system, the U.S. dollar obtains authority. Within the U.S., a government authoritative body that decides monetary policies obtains authority. It is a singular, universal and centralized authoritative system. 
Digital Age
#Phenomena: Crypto Currency
Crypto currency can potentially bring changes to the traditional system. Internet and computer create alternate virtual world. Blockchain technology provides a new currency more secure than traditional money. Blockchain based crypto currency is valid as a method of exchanging values only in a specific boundary. The subject of validation is not traditional government authority but the issuer and supporters who accepts it.  In a game, for example, those who value goods in the world of game becomes users of the game money. #32 
The exchange rate between crypto money and traditional money is unstable. It changes more frequently and in greater degrees. Also, the exchange rate randomly varies by individuals instead of systematically calculated. To say, evaluating the value of currency now becomes a subjective matter. Some people sell a rare item for $1000 while others do not even want to buy it for $100. Crypto currency is a kind of digital alternative money. Relativity of its value is a lot greater in crypto currency. 
There is a potential that alternative authorities might lessen the universal power of dollar-based economy.  There are several conditions to be fulfilled for that. First, a parallel world where the crypto currency is valid have to engage larger public. #33 Second, in order for that, the alternate world have to be equipped with widely valuable goods in it. Third, economically productive activities should enlarge and the stability of supplying those activities must be guaranteed by trustful system. Then, the alternative currency might be on an equal footing with dollar. Current surge of crypto currencies work as  a decentralizer of the traditional authority of a governing party of a single country.
#Structure
Multiple forms of money represents value in a single economic block such as a country. The same bottle of beer that costs $3.5 can also be bought for a certain amount of bitcoin in San Fransisco. Previously one form of currency covered a whole country. A dollar even covered every value in a whole world. 
#Value: Democratic, Transparent and More Secure
Democratic power distribution can be guaranteed in terms of issuing authority based on the blockchain technology. As for multiplicity of parallel digital worlds that has its own method of exchanging values means better diversity. Chronologically as well, more diverse value can be circulated; for example, a value sharing community, such as Bored Ape, Fortnite, and Roblox, is rather unstable than the world sharing traditional monetary value. #34 It is likely to last for shorter period of time than a country, a traditional value sharing community. Digital value sharing communities are short-living and frequently replaced by a new born community. 
Goods become diverse too. Personal taste is more subjective and changeable. More new products are being produced and then disappearing in shorter period; entirely new bunch of digital products - applications, images, webtoons, 3D models, etc - in addition to existing physical ones. Thus, the fluctuation period of a currency itself might be a lot shorter and the degree of rise and fall of value can be greater. Luna and Terra coin reveals this instability. 
Diversification of currency is but highly risky system for an individual economic activity. Whether decentralization of financial system will benefit general public is in question. 

[Transition]
(Baudrillard, 155) The systematic breaking down of models into series, and serises in their turn into marginal differences or combinative variants, until at last objects come to have a status just as ephemeral as that of words or images. #35

SIGN
Introduction
According to Baudrillard, objects in consumer society has come to be perceived as conceptual and immaterial sign. People purchase the symbolic meaning of a product by purchasing the physical objects. Fundamentally speaking, they consume the image and words that are embedded in an object. 
But in broader context beyond the contemporary consumer society, images and words have their own territory and history. Both types of sign has come through a digital reformation. A digital reform has changed its content, form, the relation between those two, and a value system embedded in it. 
By image it ranges any type of any human-created visual materials from painting, photography, film, a digital image and video, etc. By text it includes all linguistic production such as books, paper, magazines and online material such as ebooks, internet news, personal blog, social posts, etc. 
Traditional Age
#Phenomena: Image
A limited group of people, talented artists, produced images in the form of painting before a camera was invented and widely spread. 
In addition, types of contents and style of images were also limited. #36 The contents were universal stories of universal authority such as myth, religion, wealth and history. As for the style, the progress of representation was headed to a linear direction to the realization of realistic vision. 
Techniques of perspective and sfumato were means to an end of achieving perfectly realistic vision. Greatness of the Renaissance lies in its revolutionary progress of creating it on a two-dimensional plane of canvas. (Visual illusion of three dimensionality, trompe l’æil.) 
#Structure: Form Represents the Original 
Form was obliged to be similar to the way a real original object looks like. Image was a replica of the original, representation of it. 
#Value : Identity of Form (with the Original) 
Identity was a key to greater value. The better a painting replicates the original visual world, the more valuable it was. Perfect representation of the original was the ultimate goal of the traditional age. It was a parallel telos to that found in a watch or functional objects. A good watch in traditional era was a watch that represents time as precisely as possible. In spatial level, a good watch represented the movement of the Earth with near perfection. #37 Likewise, a good object was an object that was designed to realize an ideal image of function as precisely as possible. A good cutter should be able to make an ideal cut. A good vacuum cleaner should be able to get rid of dust and trash ideally leaving not even a single particle of dust. These were all concerned with replicating the ideal or the original. 
#Phenomena: Text
Traditional texts delivered collective value such as golden law, ethics, religious or historical facts, and general knowledge of nature of human being and the world. 
Traditionally texts were produced by selected few of religious and political authority and intellectuals. As for Christianity, the Bible is the result of thousands of years’ effort to preserve an absolute religious truth about Jesus. Texts of history are the recording of the facts; what happened without distortion. Literature is a fake story literally speaking, but its essence is designed to indirectly reveal the truth of human being through metaphors. Philosophy provides logical statements about the truth. #38 (Mathematical texts provides truth about pure logical findings about a priory numerical and geometrical world. Physics reveals hidden pattern or order behind the a posteriori material world.)
#Structure: Form as Mandatory Container of Meaning
A form has to have a clear meaning. No linguistic sign can exist without having a meaning. It is a 1 to 1 correspondence between form and content as found in the form-function relation in a traditional watch. 
Wittgenstein’s earlier philosophical pursuit was to get rid of those words that are meaningless or unable to be judged as true or false. In his writing, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, the opening and closing quotes make it clear. ‘The world is all that is the case.’ ‘What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.’  The world as the case narrows down the boundary of itself to include only those either true or false. And by silence on what we cannot speak about he exclude gray areas from the valid territory of “the world.” 
In literary field Anton Chekhov’s gun is located in the parallel context. #39 It means that if there is a gun in a story, it must be fired. In other words, every element in a story must have a dramatical function (or meaning). It should be removed if not necessary. So for example, a silent gun should not exist in a story following his theory. This theory goes in parallel with an aesthetic maxim, less is more, which explains a large portion of Modernist architecture that eliminated unnecessary ornaments to leave only the essential. 
#Value: Absolute Truth
The telos of text was delivering unchanging truth. The truth was something that holds everywhere and for everybody. Accurate description of truth was the virtue, and distortion and deviation the vice. In parallel with images, objects and time it was a pursuit of creating an identical replica of an absolutely valuable origin. Thus, all non essential elements should be eliminated to leave only the essential. Urge for ‘perfection’ in ‘representation of truth’ was the drive that moves the creation of signs. #40        
문장보다 호흡. 0912
Transcendental Technology
The telos of perfect representation of visual world was achieved by the invention of a camera. Especially, a digital camera consummates a true perfection in representation. The telos of linguistic delivery of universal truth was achieved by the invention of coding language. Camera and computer, as a tool of producing image and text, have become available for everyone. 
#Image
A camera captures perfectly realistic vision of the objective external world. The accuracy of reality of a photo-image cannot be compared with painting. Once realized as trompe l’æil (visual illusion) on a canvas, three dimensionality now has not even a minute nuance of artificial touch. It is not a visual illusion but the reality itself. In addition, this tool is not discriminate. It enables anybody to produce perfectly real image regardless a individual talent of observation and visualization. 
#Text
A perfect linguistic presentation of truth was realized by a machine language. #41 In a coding language, every single words has its clear meaning and function. This form content linkage is far more rigorous and clearer than that of Chekhov or Wittgenstein because a computer system proves by not working if there’s any words mistaken. The coding language can function properly only when given perfect unity between the form and content. All sentences are true to the system of computer. There are no room for any excess or superfluousness. 
The language of math and physics have similar characteristics. However, there are several critical difference that disqualifies them as a transcendental point. Math is a system governed by a priori logic apart from empirical world. And physics is fundamentally a rational representation of the physical world. In that sense, these languages are more like a traditional watch that is designed to track the movement of the Earth. #42 These are all governed by something absolutely valuable. Math and physics are beautiful invention and at times requires imagination. But, as for the relation with the content, they are no more than description of innate law of existing nature. 
In contrast, the language of coding is more like a smartwatch. It is more than just a representation of an existing system of nature. It creates a new system just like a smartwatch builds a new personal unit of time. It extends the world by creating a new entity that actually works in reality while physics is a discovery of the order in the existing entity and system. 
Digital Age
#Phenomena in Form: Diversifying Media, Variable Modes of Expression
Painting is not confined in realistic style of representation anymore. Beginning from Cezanne, the fall of perspectival system culminates in cubist paintings of Braque and Picasso. #44 After the invention of a camera painters began to show uniquely personal style of visualization —  Mondrian’s geometrical abstraction, Bacon’s distortion of form, Duchamp’s ready-made, etc. They even broke out of the illusion of canvas to the real physical world as in Louis Bourgeois’s installations. The media of manifesting images is not limited to the craftsmanship of painting anymore. Photography and film becomes another strong method of delivering contents of individual emotions and ideas. 
Likewise, texts has been emancipated from traditional formal constraints. Posts on personal social channels are just as short as a sentence or a word. Those texts delivers momentary impressions that are soon to be evaporated rather than lasting truths for entire human beings. Any kinds of text can be published to be accessible to anyone online. Web novels (genre novels) and Webtoon creates a new category of literature. Length varies and literary style has broadened. However, an informal and broken language doesn’t block the online publishing of online texts. #45
#Phenomena in Content: Characteristics Change
The range of subject enlarges now to include the individual and specific instead of universal. / Temporality and effervescence replace eternality. Concrete instead of abstract, worldly imperfection instead of ideal perfection. / Personal urge or emotion, momentary sentiments, ugliness, kitsch, personal ideas, and opinions on social agenda all becomes the valid subject of image. #43 Non-dramatic and even meaningless everyday scenes can now be able to become a new content of an image. Just anything can be made into an image. An unintended mistake of pushing a shutter button on your phone creates a random image of shaken vision of the pavement you were stepping on. 
Text delivers as broad range of subjects as images do. Not anymore confined by serious truth of history or religion and the nature of the world. It delivers even silly, light, daily issues. History is neither perfectly objective and fixed nor universal anymore. As E. H. Carr wrote, history is now an unending dialogue between the present and the past. It constantly changes according to the temporal and spatial context of a historian. Giedion also emphasizes that 
Giedion 5. History is not simply the repository of unchanging facts, but a process, a pattern of living and changing attitudes and interpretations. … The backward look transforms its object ; every spectator at every period inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature. Absolute points of reference are no more open to the historian than they are to the physicist ; both produce descriptions relative to a particular situation.
#Phenomena in Production: Production Increases and Producer Varies
Anybody becomes a creator with a smartphone. As larger amount of images as made easier are produced. Millions of thousands of images and videos are created and shared. 720,000 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every day . 95 million photos and videos are shared on instagram daily . Images and texts uploaded on social platforms flourishes and are fast gone as if evaporate. 
#Structure: Form Defeats Content
Media is Message. It is not anymore that content(message) defines the form(media), but the other way. Form is now independent from content. Some forms exist without a meaning. #46
Silent Gun, No Problem. In literature a loaded gun may well not be fired. In Haruki’s novel, 1Q84, a protagonist assassin Aomame’s gun appears more than 10 times  but it never shoots anyone. The gun is functionless or meaningless, or it has a very personal function different from the practical primary function; resolution or meditation of Aomame. 
Signifier without Signified. Some forms are intentionally meaningless. In a drama or a film, MacGuffin is designed to be meaningless only intriguing audience’s attention. It is a valid technique though and worthy for its superficial intrigue. For example, a Rabbit Foot in Mission Impossible is seemingly critical, but what it is or how it is important never reveals until the film ends. #47 A container - an image or text - exist not necessarily with a content. 
#Value: Specific Moments, Subjective Scenes
An individual scenery replaces universal one, a collective and objective scene. Those individual sceneries are not fixed but constantly changes. People catch all different parts and moments of the world with their camera. In the fast changing context, timely expression of temporary issue matters as much as delivering a message of universal importance. 
[Transition]
Architectural space all encompasses the aspects of time, objects and sign. Built space is a source of time and cannot be separated from time especially in the context of modern physics. It is better to say space-time. At the same time it is an object of use value or exchange value. It is also a sign, both image and text, in the sense that architectural form delivers a symbolic message or pure aesthetic feeling . #48 However, space-time is much more than the sum of the source of time, object and sign. 

Space-time

Introduction
All human activities occur in space-time. People discover new continents, define a territory and build spaces in it. 
#Physical Space and Digital Space
Given environment of nature where human body resides is physical space. It includes areas of wild nature and urban space of human civilization all together. Digital space is virtual space, which is not necessarily three dimensional; Websites, space in a game, VR experiential space. It is made mainly by visual information.
#Static Space and Mobile Space
Physical built space comprises static space and mobile space. Buildings - residence, museums, gym, office, schools, factory, retail shop, storage, parkings - are different part of static space. Mobile space is designed to carry people or goods. #49 Transportations - bikes, automobiles, boats and planes - have mobile space. 
#End Space and Means(Utilitarian) Space 
Spaces can be classified into two categories based on a purpose of space. End Space i s an essential and inseparable part of the incident. Residence is a space where the inhabitant’s presence itself is sufficient reason of its being. Experiential spaces such as gym or restaurant always embody customer’s bodily presence. Bodily presence is essential for its reason of being. Either way, there is no other purpose for users to be there other than reside and have bodily activities in end space.  
On the other hand, Means Space is a separable backdrop inessential for the incident. Users come to means space in order to achieve a specific purpose that doesn’t necessarily embody bodily presence; such as shopping, banking, computer gaming, etc. Means space is no more than a physical background for a utilitarian activity that doesn’t accompany any interaction between body and space. The essence of shopping is to take a necessary good to home. #50 Banking is transferring money from one account to another. Gaming is entertaining activity in a digital space. — These purposes can be covered by digital space like websites. Digital space is immaterial indirectly taking absolutely reduced physical presence, only server hardware, where ideal functional efficiency is achieved for users anywhere, anytime. 
#Existential Space and Experiential Space
End space comprises two types of spaces depending on the mode of interaction. Internal care and organization vs interaction with external world. 
Traditional Age
#Phenomena: Pure Functional Form
Le Corbusier is a representative figure of modern architecture in 20th century. He defined a house as Machine for Living. It implicates that architectural space is a purely functional product. The first apartment housing, Unite D’habitation, or a temporary worker’s housing, Weissenhof Siedlung, was the result of his machine aesthetics. The functionalism of machine aesthetics reduced the form to the minimum by eliminating superfluous ornamentation to leave only those with a function. In this manner, it is not different from writings of Wittgenstein and Chekhov. #51 Both of them didn’t allow excess words or dramatic objects that were empty, without clear meaning or function. What a silent gun was to Chekhov was what a functionless pilaster or decorative entablature was to Le Corbusier. 
The pursuit of function was a pursuit of perfection. The ultimate goal existed only in the ideal realm of idea. To divide the history in terms of digital and physical, Le Corbusier was the culmination of a whole traditional age. Nevertheless, the traditional stream ended up a decorative purism losing its primarily functional origin.
Function oriented aesthetics of purism has dissolved in Internationalism architecture. The simple geometric formal aspect replaced the function to become primary factor of design. To say, Internationalism was different from Le Corbusier’s because it was a decorative purism instead of functional purism. In internationalism pure form was pure for the sake of pure form. #52 Venturi wrote about this with the simile of a duck. 
Venturi-Vegas…118/  modern architecture - the whole building as one big decoration; a duck. 
Borrowing a Baudrillard’s terms, a secondary function of phantasy forestalled a practical primary function. And this transfer from functional object to aesthetic image was further accelerated by the consumerism driven by mass media. 
#Structure: Form Follows Function
It was first told by Louis Sullivan who Le Corbusier and Frank Loyd Wright worked for. Form was valid only if it was designed to be purely functional. The other form or words are excess. 
#Value: Universal, Immaterial and ideally functional (Result Effectivity/Means Efficiency )
Telos of Static Space
Architectural space has gone through a long functional and aesthetic journey. The journey was headed to two directions, perfect functionality and universal geometric  form.
The first direction was functional perfection as a functional object. #53 The second was universal form as an image through geometrical abstraction ultimately for immateriality . For example, Unite d’Habitation is a very functional housing solution with repetition of similar units to accommodate large population moving to urban area. Corbusier’s five points were also summary of essential elements for maximization of its functionality. A roof garden for inviting nature into the dense urbanity, open plan with bare minimum interruption of columns, ribbon(strip) windows for framing the panoramic scenery along the wall that didn’t need to be load-bearing. Pilotti structure on the ground level was for efficient use of ground also allowing for public access and car parking. 
—
A car was fundamentally different from static space, but it was an element of another significant category of architectural space having parallel importance to dwelling space. 
Baudrillard 67. Car rivals the house as an alternative zone of daily life…
Ingrid 149… Le Corbusier proclaims“a house is like a motor-car, conceived and carried out like an omnibus or ship’s cabin.” [31] Le Corbusier, Towards a New Architecture, 240.’ #54
Ingrid 215. The car as modernist sign of motion and lived experience
Frampton 5th 214. Frank Loyd Wright… The car as the ‘democratic’ mode of locomotion was to be the deus ex machina…  
Telos of Mobile Space
What is the ultimate goal of mobile space? What does a perfectly functional mobility mean? 
This can be considered in two different aspects; result effectivity and means efficiency. The first is concerned with maximizing the speed of a vehicle. The second with emancipating a driver from the labor of driving. Theoretically speaking, especially in terms of time, the essence of both aspects of accomplishing telos is to eliminating time consumption in the journey to the destination. That is the key to make a perfectly functional mobile space. #55
There are two concrete methods to accomplish the pursuit of ideal mobile space for each of two aspects. They are based upon different interpretation of the task at hand - eliminating time consumption in a journey to destination.
Baudrillard 59. Tail fins were a sign not of real speed but of a sublime, measureless speed.
Chris van Uffelen 7. “We declare that the splendor of the world has been enriched by a new beauty, the beauty of speed…” “… a roaring motor car which seems to run on machine-gun fire, is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace.” So said Tommaso Marinetti in the Futurist Manifesto.
The first method, theoretically speaking, is near-light speed journey. The quality of mobile space where a user stays is secondary concern to speed as primary. Mobility technology has been constantly and gradually developed along the history; through inventions from bike, motorcycle and automobile to plane, jets, rockets. Some planes can fly faster than the sound. Nevertheless, infinity of speed is not realizable from the beginning. #56 In order to reduce time consumption to near zero, the speed has to increase to be infinity. But, an ordinary vehicle of physical mass cannot be accelerated because of physical restrictions based on the theory of relativity.
The second method is reducing the human labor of journey. Ideally speaking, eliminating time consumption in this method has two requirements. Perfect automation of locomotion and realization of static environment in mobile space. Major focus is in reverse to the first method. The actual speed of movement is secondary concern to the quality of mobile space such as comfort level. Cars have constantly been getting easier to drive by minor automation of gear shift and supportive alarm system for safety. Fully autonomous driving technology is improving and already being tested as well. Theoretically speaking, hiring a private driver has the similar effect to AI-driven self driving. #57 It is to eliminate time consumption in moving by changing the interior of car into a working or resting space. This is why people in power hire their own drivers. They gain freedom and the space becomes similar to their office or home.
As for public transportation, people collectively share a driver. To say, the emancipation from the labor of driving is already being achieved in a bus, cruise, or plane but with sacrifice. Personal cars have limited comfort level compared with residence or office. Public transportations are even more limited. During the journey, people have to sacrifice privacy, personal itinerary, discomforts of noise, bump and smell, etc. At the moment, the second method is only very partially being realized. An equal level of comfort and access to normal activities as in static space is hardly guaranteed. First class seats in a cruise or airplane provides much better environments, but they are mostly unavailable to general public. #58
Transcendental Technology
#Static-means Space: Ideally Functional, Completely Immaterial
Digital space in the world wide web is universal space with ultimate efficiency. It especially obtains both functional perfection and formally pure aesthetics at the same time without sacrificing one of them in any degree. Modernist architecture in traditional age gave up functionality in order to better achieve formal purism. Symbolic modern material of glass was excellent for visual purity, but it was not the most functional material in terms of strength and thermal insulation. The conflict was inevitable considering that it was pursuing physical functionality, whether it is functionality of the space  itself or of the utilitarian activity that takes place in it, and physical minimalism at the same time. And the result was an ornamental transparent box of simplistic geometry where function was compromised, which was described as a duck by Venturi. 
Online digital space breaks through this inevitable conflict between form and function by physical absence. Above all, dissolution of physical presence is the ultimatum of modern pursuit of purity, immateriality, and universality — a collection of particular shapes which retained their full value wherever they were transplanted as Giedion describes. (706) This invisible space is perfectly immaterial and thus perfectly pure. It retains its full value wherever there is an internet access. #59
As for functionality, physical absence simplifies two aspects of functionality into one. It leaves the functionality of utilitarian activity. The other one, spatial functionality such as ventilation. thermal, lighting, safety, and endurance, doesn’t need to be considered anymore. The program in digital space achieves ultimate efficiency. The functionality of programs in means space are not mainly concerned with qualitatively effective result but with quantitatively efficient procedure. For example, banking or grocery shopping is best done when you spend the least time and effort to get the same result of transferring money or purchasing a shampoo. (for sure unless you truly enjoy the process of staying in those places and communicating with banker or cashier, but it is a out of question here.) Internet space is a perfectly functional platform in this context. It is accessible anywhere and anytime with your mobile. Several clicks or touches are enough to complete a desired task, be it wire transfer or shopping. #60
#Static-end Space: Remaining Intact
The program of this category of space, residence, gym, stadium, etc., are difficult to be realized in digital space. Whether it is existential or experiential, physical space and bodily engagement with it is essential part of the program. However, some of experiential space are being replaced by VR based digital space.  This is especially the case when the space doesn’t have unique identity that differentiates from other places. For example, an ordinary gym can easily be realized in VR space. But, Grand Canyon where you hike is less easier to be replaced by VR space although ironically those unique places are more attractive target of digitalizing. As for existential space, it is irrelevant to be replaced by any form of digital space. Residence has no other external purpose other than a place where your body and mind just exist for well being. [예외 - Q연결]
#Mobile Space:  Transfer of Information & Locomotion of Room
Digital space consummates the telos of mobile space, zero time consumption of journey, in two different ways. 
The first is maximizing speed of mobility. #61 Journey of digital signal is the key here because a physical mass has very limited potential of acceleration. Digital information can travel at near the speed of light. Thus if the digital information can realize a certain space where a user intends to visit, it results in the accomplishment of (almost) non time consuming journey. Accessing digital spaces such as websites is reversed way of moving to the destination. In traditional physical space, people had to move to their desired destination. But, now the destination comes to the point where the user is located. This holds when the purpose of journey is concerned with means space such as shopping or some experiential space such as gaming. These digital spaces eliminates the need for journey from the beginning. As mentioned before, not all end space can be realized in digital space. Thus people still should physically move to some places such as residence or historical or natural place.  #62
The second is emancipation from the labor of driving. In order to eliminate the time consumption of journey this method reduces the distance between the departure and destination while the first method maximizes speed. The identity of the space of a car changes in this context. From the outside the car is obviously a mobile space because it is actually moving. However, from the perspective of a user on board, the car is not different from a small room in a house, which is a static space. This might sound like nonsense but it is not because we all live in a moving planet. Every human being is on board in a huge spherical car named the Earth. Thus the definition of static and mobile is fundamentally relative. What matters in categorization is whether the passenger is obliged to drive the vehicle or not. For a passenger free from driving the space of a car is just like a static room. #63
To make it convincing, for sure, self driving technology needs to develop more. Additionally the space needs to become more like a static room. Stability of driving, comfort level, spaciousness, and equal access to activities as given in a static space are major necessities to make the interior of a car into a static room. The size of space might be limited because the whole transportation infrastructure is built based on the current size of a car. But the other factors are all possible scenario. The development of AI will increase the basic stability of self driving to the totally reliable level, and with AI capable of calculating an optimum solution of traffic control will guarantee comfort level. More developed control system can avoid abrupt acceleration and deceleration. It is important for both driving comfort, carbon emission and resource efficiency, thus providing a sufficient incentive(inducement) to develop.

Digital Age
#OVERVIEW
Phenomena: End Space Dominates
End space is essential and inseparable part of the incident occurring within it. It is either existential or experiential. #64 Means space is no more than an inessential backdrop separable from the incident. Means space in physical space are moving to digital space that enables ultimate efficiency to accomplish the program (utilitarian function). In result end space occupies the majority of physical space transforming it into a personal theatrical stage or an immersive exhibition hall. Lastly, digital space that absorbs all means space further extends itself to a virtual end space where the virtual space is essential and inseparable part of the incident. It is hard to forecast how big it will expand because digital space is unlimited unlike physical space. 

Structure : Self Reliance  of End Space
So far dealing with signs and objects, form and content were discussed and analyzed as two separate entity. According to Susan Sontag, the form-content separation was originated from the mimetic theory of Greek philosophers. 
(Sontag, 96) All Western consciousness … of art have remained within the confines staked out by the Greek theory of art as mimesis or representation… something we have learned to call “form” is separated off from something we have learned to call “content,”…
It implies that there are cases where wholistic form and content is not separated as a whole. End space counts as one of the case. #65 It is a form and content at the same time. It does not represent or denotes something else but itself. It is self fulfilled and self reliant entity.
***
Take ‘word’ for example. ‘Word’ is a form or a signifier. It is a container of a meaning. Then what is its content or meaning? It means a word just like its form is ‘word.’ The form of ‘word’ belongs to the territory of its own meaning. Salk Institute is another example. It is an architecture of ‘gap.’ ‘Gap’ is an overarching formal theme. Different variations of void between two solids compose the whole form. #66 From smaller to larger scale, the ‘gap’ becomes a gutter, the marker of point where two perpendicular walls encounter, a light well, a long corridor open to outside, and finally the open court between north and south wings that face the Pacific Ocean. Further on in an even larger scale, the space of the whole building is a ‘gap’ between the ocean to the west and the land to the east. In addition to this planar level, it is again a ‘gap’ between the sky and the Earth. And finally, the gap as in-betweenness extends its scale beyond the physical to the metaphysical. The (ancient  Asian) understanding of human being as an existence between the sky and the Earth, and the metaphysical and the physical. This space for human being in the form of ‘gap’ is at the same time a meaning of itself, ‘in-betweenness.’

This is entirely different structure of form and content from those found in symbolic or formalistic space. The form of a set of architectural elements of pilaster, pediment, column - the Dorian, the Ionic, the Corinthian, and entablature is symbolic forms of Western architecture. Its form does not contain the meaning in itself but denotes something outside itself. The form represents the cultural background. #67 The form of formalist objects are missing a meaning or denying to have a meaning or function. It is just an empty material form independent from the meaning or function. It contains nothing and exists as its material self. 
End space is essential and inseparable part of the incident occurring within it. When somebody is taking a rest with a cup of coffee in his house, the material form of the house cannot be separated from the incident of taking a rest in it. When someone is taking a walk on a street in Manhattan, the surrounding urban space cannot be separated from the act of walking. The program of the space is not outside of it, but equivalent with space. The space itself consists the essence of the program, what happens in it, to say the content. Form itself is meaning just like ‘word’ is a word and formal ‘gap’ means in-betweenness. 
[맨뒤로위치조정] Value: Individual, Temporal, Unique & Genius Loci
Form is independent from content. The content is not absolute but has unlimited room for interpretation. The types of correspondence between form and content vary; Superficial form without meaning or function. Same form has different meanings depending on a context or individual interpretation. Form is content when Form is even not detached from content as in end space.
In the dominance of end space, procedure has greater significance than consequence because every continuous momentary sentiment is what matters rather than a simple result at the end of all process. #68 Existence and experience is fundamentally personal and the quality varies specific to individuals. 
In a personal level, concrete temporal feeling has great significance. It might be an emotion or bodily sensation. These are always within a temporal and spatial context different from rational thinking such as mathematics detached from the temporal reality. So, unique inherent identity of a place, as in natural environment and historical sites, is preserved and enhanced. Regionally varying architectural space replaces universal one that is designed to be planted just anywhere. 
Feeling is not an isolated phenomena but appears from the interaction between an individual and the external world. Thus, it is always continuous and wholistic rather than separated and fragmental. The feelings are inherently unique to each individual and constantly changes depending when and where someone is located. 
In a collective level, these unique individuals come together to form a heterogeneous society. A heterogeneous society is naturally a pluralist society where diversity is virtue and individual difference is respected. #69 The respect presumes and requires egalitarianism fundamental level. 
#Phenomena
Physical-Static-Means Space: New Gallery for Non-art
Majority of its existing portion is moving to digital space. Digital space provides ideal functional efficiency in terms of cost and time. In the process of both sales and purchase, the cost that comes from physical space, logistics of goods and consumers’ transportation cost, is saved. 
Giedion 424. Luxury … does not simply mean waste of material, but only makes sense when it broadens emotional experience by means of new discovery…. Wright achieves … a new spatial sensation without which it is not possible to think of architecture.
Physical experience can’t be replaced easily by digital space. So, the vacated space becomes inspiring experiential space instead of utilitarian task space (exchanging money, service, goods). It is becoming a gallery or museum with its own collection of experience, the repertoire of which regularly changes. It is concerned with the quality of life, especially the temporal life that people spend at the place.
ex. Shopping is not just about the purchase of necessary goods anymore. It is about pleasant interaction with staffs, gathering with people of similar interest like what’s happening in Helinox brand store. #70 It is also about appreciation of the attractive physical space and the process of looking through and selecting desired goods. Visitors actually try a real product with their hands as in IKEA or Apple store. Cafes are also more than a cup of tasty coffee. Going to a cafe means meeting with specialists and learn about coffee as in Koffee Mameya located in Tokyo. It is to spend quality time in a well designed relaxing place having conversation with friends or resting in silence. Starbucks has long been providing this environment. A library or a bookstore is not simply a place that lends books. It is an ideal environment for the activity of reading and exchanging knowledge. The quality of temporal life during the visit to the library matters the most. The consequence, mere expansion of knowledge, is only a part of functions of library. #71
Physical-Static-End Space: Private Stage
Residential space is becoming a theater in the sense where you act rather than watch others act. This comes from the influence of VR technology, the first method of accomplishing the telos of mobile space. Physical setting is mostly fixed but the program of space changes upon a temporal needs of an individual. A versatile physical stage for multiple programs that occur in digital setting. A home is a multi functional and flexible place as per subjective contexts — home training, home theater, offce, a library for ebooks, online shoppping center, remote hospital for medical treatment. 
Physical-Mobile-Means Space: Another Home
Baudrillard 66… the automobile represents a kind of no-man’s land between workplace and family home, an empty vector of pure transport
This no-man’s land can now become extension of dwelling space. A car becomes a part of residence by the influence of self driving technology. The automation of driving will emancipate users from the labor of driving. They just exist in the space of a car during a journey. Thus, the previously mobile space is now more like a static end space. 
In more detailed classification, utilitarian mobile space comprises private space and public space such as car versus public transits. #72 Static end space can also be divided to residential space and experiential space by privacy measure. The private and public mobile space respectively become like an extension of residential(private stage) and experiential(gallery) space. 
At the moment, this hasn’t happened in fullest degree. There are just a small clues yet. In addition, it is not that the interior space of private and public transportations will become exactly like residence or experiential space. Vehicles are always subject to spatial capacity restrictions and traffic regulations. Still, the direction of pursuit will be toward that of static end space — maximizing the comfort level in negotiation with efficient and safe journey. Several conditions need be cleared in order for this change to fully accomplished: Full automation of self driving, guarantee of safety, legal issues, equal level of access to activities available in static spaces, spaciousness, etc. 

Hyundai  electric car line ups focus on spacious interior space. #73 Airforce One is an existing case of a mobile space as a moving residence for the president. More general example is a camping car or an intercity express bus although comfort level is significantly sacrificed.  
Physical-Mobile-End Space: Pure Journey
Baudrillard 66. Travel is a necessity, and speed is a pleasure. … The material that it transforms, namely space-time, cannot be compared to any other. … Movement alone is the basis of a sort of happiness… Effortless mobility entails a kind of pleasure that is unrealistic, a kind of suspension of existence, a kind of absence of responsibility. …
Mobile end space differs from mobile means space in that journey itself is not a means to arrive at a destination but the end. More qualitative aspects of the process of journey itself matters other than the efficiency of journey and the resultant arrival. 
The privileged hires personal drivers for the purpose of travel of necessity. But, they drive by themselves when they want to appreciate the sheer pleasure of journey; pleasure of driving or a romantic date with a lover. #74 In terms of time, driving has an effect of temporal detachment from the static others. Those in a car are moving in the same speed and thus exclusively in the same flow of time. Attractions in amusement parks are other examples. Six flags roller coaster gives an exceptionally abnormal bodily sensation by its dynamic movement at an excessively high speed. The train in the end come back to the point of departure, but it is not the arrival but the journey itself that counts. 
Digital-Means Space: A Blackhole
Digital space is where the pursuit of perfect functionality, universality and immateriality in traditional age is realized. Those activities that do not necessarily require physical setting all naturally moves to the digital space. Shopping, banking, e-Library, Online Schools are examples. These are gaining much more efficiency by sacrificing physical experience. 
Digital-End Space: Rising Dark Horse
Digital residence and digital experience are increasing its volume with the development of VR technologies. #75 Strength of VR is that it visualize three dimensionality that runs in a perfect synchronization with a user’s body movement. Digital space has always been there on a two dimensional screen. Instagram is two dimensional experiential gallery in digital space. Fortnight is three dimensional experiential space with just a little limitation of synchronization with our body. Visual illusion of three dimensionality has long been invented by Renaissance artists and engineers such as Leonardo da Vinci and Panofsky. What is revolutionary is that now we are having three dimensional visual illusion that has temporality, to say, that reacts to the users’ bodily motion.
The addition of temporal dimension makes three dimensional vision into more than a fake or an illusion. VR space is an alternate space of physical one enabled by digital technology. The alternate space has been subordinate or supportive to a ‘real’ or ‘original’ physical space. However, the size of virtual space is growing more and more to be easily larger than the physical one. #76 When the time comes, people might spend more time in virtual space. It is not different from a computer game mania spending a whole day playing a game. The fakeness of the game become a nonsense if activities in physical space can happen in virtual space. And we are all living the period of possibility of the parallel or reverse between the virtual and the real. Meta-verse already exists, and it’s just getting as real and significant as the real universe.
The seeds are already sowed and growing up in everyday lives. Living in DTLA, I would put on a Bose Wireless QuietComfort Ear set to block endless noises. Then, my playlist of meditation songs and natural sounds - raining, thunderstorm, white noise, etc - begin to play. It gives me soothing, relaxing sensation. It almost saves me from the sonic chaos of downtown. And I would say, if VR glasses are not as heavy, voluminous and tiring as at the moment and are just as simple as a typical headset, I wouldn’t mind at all wearing it instead of the ear pods. #77 Lots of hurdles to go over yet, but perhaps the goal is not too far away. 
#Structure of Dominating End Space 
Residence, as a private stage, contains more functions. Experiential space will flourish in the rest of physical space. Mobile space will entirely become an end space, either experiential or existential. These increase of end space comes from digitalization of utilitarian space. 
End space is free of mimetic theory because it is form and content at the same time. It is more than a linguistic sign or visual sign that denotes meaning. It is also more than an object produced to function. It is an extension of human beings who reside there. 
There is ever more potential to make larger space count as more than a property of monetary value, more than a effective machine, more than a sculptural image detached from life, and more than a message of powerful authority of a nation, corporation or religious group. #78 In order to achieve the potential to expand end space, architects need to be more than a salesman, an engineer, a visual artist or a writer. An architect should be able to resist monopolizing power of market, science, art or politics. An architect should be able to orchestrate all those powers to make a whole that is more than a simple sum of those parts.

Epilogue: What Platonic Pandemic Left Us
Climate change is not a diastrophism but a man-made disaster. So is the pandemic. Bats’ habitat change caused by global warming spread the germ. It gave us some tips on how to get through this crisis at hand. 
Object — Minimize Physical Presence for Nature
We had an extraordinarily long absence of human presence in nature during quarantine. And we saw the power of resilience of nature. It turned out that nature can recover when it is given enough time. It was also proved that how inaction can be a powerful solution for a rapid climate change, more powerful than any sort of human scientific action. 
So far, reduction and simplification have been methods that were meant to serve human pursuit of ideal rationality. Now it is time to consider them as a way of respecting nature. For greater nature, human life can be reduced and simplified as Henry David Thorough claimed in his book, Walden. #79
Nature is not an object. It is an environment that is always surrounding and embracing the entire human territory. Thus it will never work to see nature as a resource of human tools. It’s not that we rule and exhaust nature, but that nature generously lends us its resource. We are not the owner of nature. We are a tenant in nature. If we keep sticking to narrow sighted misunderstanding the embracing arms of nature will soon completely turn to suffocating tie. What really matters the most is not implementing almighty human scientific solution but just stop wrong doings
Sign — Maximize Digital Presence for Nature
During unexpected quarantine it turned out that digital tools had greater capacity to replace physical activities. Remote communication through image and text, like Zoom, is an effective alternative of in person meeting. Immateriality of digital methods helps reducing emission thus preserving nature. #80
Of course more R&D is required to increase authenticity of remote communication and prevent its side effect such as digital fatigue. For example, to advance digital tools to be as competent as physical methods, to figure out how to reduce distractive impacts of using digital tools for a long time, to figure out proper degree of digitalizing our daily lives. 
Space-time — Sit there, Stop, Be Yourself First and Begin from There
Lots of people had an uncommon opportunity to be alone during the pandemic. We were alone at home mostly in silence, and found out that how space has direct and significant influence on our mode of being. How time flows differently residing in different spaces. Just being in your room makes the room look entirely different, and it is the genuine observation of the room. We also experienced how the space can lead us to look inside ourselves and discover a unique individual rhythm. The space is neither a mere tool of managing one finance nor a simple functional box where we eat and sleep. A space is reflection of our inner self and entry to ourselves. It gives us more critical sense that determines a deep primary feeling on how we live every moment. #81
Panofsky, 44 / Aristotle conceived this “general space” as merely the furthest frontier of an absolutely large body… there is no energeiai apeiron (actual infinite) which would extend beyond the Dasein of individual objects
Thus space and human are not separate entities. They are bound together, and one influences the other and vice versa. We make a better space and then we become a better person. We become a better person and then we make a better space. We experienced a very meaningful halt although totally unintended, and we saw who we are and what is inside us. I hope we do not forget it because forgetting it is losing it. I hope we act on the possibility. Without a doubt, we are a better being than who we have been so far.
